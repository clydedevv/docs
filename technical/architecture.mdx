# Detailed Technical Architecture

This document provides the implementation details for the maxBTC strategy execution system. For a high-level overview, see the [Server Architecture](/technical/maxbtc_server) page.

## Implementation Details

The server is built in Rust and follows a modular design pattern. Communication between modules happens through shared database state and the global JLP token tracking system. The application uses:

- **Axum** for HTTP endpoints
- **Tokio** for asynchronous background processes
- **Direct RPC/WebSocket** connections to blockchain networks and exchanges

    - Converts 70% of assets to USDC for JLP buying
    - Handles JLP position entry in tranches
  </Card>

  <Card title="Exposure Management" icon="scale-balanced">
    - Runs delta exposure calculations every minute

    - Updates main documentation and logs execution details
  </Card>

  <Card title="Fee Hedge" icon="money-bill-transfer">
    - Handles revenue rebalancing

    - Manages JLP/BTC price impact
  </Card>

  <Card title="Reporting" icon="chart-line">
    - Calculates NAV based on all positions

## Security Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="API Key Management">
    Binance API Keys: IPs are whitelisted and only allowed to trade. Read only keys can work without IP whitelisting for monitoring - Ceffu
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Microservice Architecture">
    Microservices are made mutually exhaustive to each other - sync if required, but can be done with a lag, we do it on timestamp based. Example, input module should be in sync with Cefi-Defi Exposure Management
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="System Recovery">
    System reset - should resume based on data from CEX's position and JLP position in the multi-sig
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Binance Security">
    Whitelist address - Multi-sig or the ETH SC, Ceffu setup
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Scope for Multi-sig

The multi-sig is responsible for critical operations:

- Buying capability of JLP
- Sell Capability of JLP
- Transfer to CEX
- Whitelist CEX addresses

## Codebase Organization

The codebase is organized into logical modules:

- **src/rpc/**: Contains Solana and other blockchain RPC client implementations
- **src/external_ws/**: WebSocket clients for exchange data and order execution
- **src/models/**: MongoDB data models for persisting strategy state
- **src/fetch_systems/**: Data retrieval from various external systems
- **src/exposure_management/**: Core strategy execution logic
- **src/execution/**: Trade execution and order management

The server uses a shared global state for JLP token tracking (JLP_TOKENS) which acts as an in-memory cache that is periodically verified against on-chain data.
