# Private Deposits Technical Implementation

This document details the technical implementation of the private deposits (PD) phase of maxBTC.

## Smart Contract Design

The Ethereum smart contract for private deposits has been designed with simplicity and security in mind. It provides the following functionality:

```solidity
// Simplified representation of the contract
contract StructuredPrivateDeposits {
    // Token to be received by users
    ERC20 public spdBTC;
    
    // Token accepted for deposits
    ERC20 public WBTC;
    
    // Custody address where deposits are forwarded
    address public custodyAddress;
    
    // Owner/admin multisig
    address public owner;
    
    // Mapping of allowed addresses
    mapping(address => bool) public allowlist;
    
    // Function to deposit WBTC and mint spdBTC
    function deposit(uint256 amount) external {
        require(allowlist[msg.sender], "Not on allowlist");
        // Transfer WBTC from user
        WBTC.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        
        // Mint spdBTC to user
        spdBTC.mint(msg.sender, amount);
        
        // Forward WBTC to custody
        WBTC.transfer(custodyAddress, amount);
    }
    
    // Admin functions for allowlist management
    function addToAllowlist(address user) external onlyOwner {
        allowlist[user] = true;
    }
    
    function removeFromAllowlist(address user) external onlyOwner {
        allowlist[user] = false;
    }
}
```

## UI Restriction Mechanics

{/* [IMAGE NEEDED: Add a diagram showing the authentication flow] */}

Since UI restrictions won't completely protect against unauthorized depositors (due to the nature of public blockchains), we've implemented a multi-layered approach:

1. **Allowlist on Smart Contract**: Only whitelisted addresses can interact with the deposit function
2. **Cloudflare Email Gate**: Restricts access to the UI based on approved email addresses
3. **KYC Integration**: All participants must complete KYC verification before being added to the allowlist

## Technical Considerations for WBTC

We've chosen to accept only WBTC for several reasons:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Standardization">
    Using a single asset type simplifies the contract design and reduces security risks
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Liquidity">
    WBTC has significant liquidity on Ethereum, making it easier for participants to acquire
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Legal Considerations">
    We cannot accept direct BTC deposits for legal reasons, so we use the widely-accepted wrapped version
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Compatibility">
    WBTC integrates well with the rest of our infrastructure, including Binance and custody solutions
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## BBTC Consideration

We considered using BBTC (Binance-Wrapped BTC) for clients who already have BTC on Binance, as this could save on fees/slippage of converting WBTC to BTC on Binance. However, we decided against it for several reasons:

1. **Additional Development**: It would require additional smart contract development, which is challenging given the tight timeline
2. **UI Complexity**: The UI would need to support two different assets instead of one
3. **Cost Distribution**: Creates an imbalance where BBTC depositors subsidize WBTC depositors

## Monitoring Implementation

<img src="/images/monitoring-dashboard.png" alt="Monitoring Dashboard" />
{/* [IMAGE NEEDED: Add a screenshot or mockup of the monitoring dashboard] */}

Our monitoring system focuses on two primary risk scenarios:

1. **Funds Security**: Constant monitoring of balances across all platforms
2. **Liquidation Risk**: Real-time monitoring of position health and collateral levels

The monitoring dashboard provides:
- Real-time position status
- Collateral levels and safety margins
- Historical performance metrics
- Alert systems for potentially dangerous market movements

## Technical Timeline

The development and deployment process follows this timeline:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Smart Contract Development & Testing">
    Development of the Ethereum contract for WBTC deposits (Completed)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Security Audit">
    Comprehensive audit by Oak Security (In Progress)
  </Step>
  <Step title="UI Development">
    Creation of the deposit interface and dashboard (In Progress)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integration Testing">
    End-to-end testing of deposit flows and monitoring systems
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deployment & Verification">
    Deployment to mainnet and final verification
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Integration with maxBTC

At the end of the private deposits phase, we will facilitate a migration to the full maxBTC token. This will involve:

1. Creating a contract that allows for exchanging spdBTC for maxBTC
2. Ensuring all underlying positions are properly transferred to the maxBTC system
3. Providing a seamless transition for users who wish to continue with the strategy
