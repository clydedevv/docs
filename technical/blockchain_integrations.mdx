maxBTC operates across multiple blockchains to optimize yield generation while maintaining security. This document details our implementation across different chains.

## Solana Integration

Solana integration serves a primary purpose: extracting yield from Jupiter Liquidity Provider (JLP) tokens.

<Note>
JLP is an LP token of the Jupiter Perpetuals pool. Essentially, it's an index token of 5 assets (SOL, ETH, BTC, USDC, USDT). Besides that, it also compounds Jupiter trading fees and traders' PnL.
</Note>

### Jupiter Perpetuals Overview

High-level operations of the "JLP" part are:

1. Getting deposits from Ethereum/Binance to Solana
2. Processing withdrawals back to Ethereum
3. Rebalancing positions when needed

### Jupiter Integration Challenges

When interacting with Jupiter's JLP, there are several limitations to consider:

1. **Total TVL Cap**: We cannot provide more assets than the platform limit (current remaining quota is approximately 320M)
2. **Per-asset Limit**: We cannot provide more than the target weightage +20% for each asset
3. **Asset Restrictions**: From Binance on Solana, we can only withdraw SOL, USDC, and USDT

<Warning>
The current target weightage for BTC is 11%, thus it can fluctuate only between 8.8% and 13.2%. However, if the current weight exceeds this range (e.g., 14.63%), no BTC can be provided despite what the UI might show.
</Warning>

## Ethereum Integration

The Ethereum blockchain is used for:

1. Accepting user deposits (WBTC)
2. Minting maxBTC tokens
3. Processing redemptions

Our smart contracts on Ethereum include vault contracts for custodying assets and token contracts for the maxBTC synthetic asset.

## Cross-Chain Asset Flow

The following diagram shows how assets flow through the system:

    box Ethereum
    participant User as User's wallet
    participant WBTC_Vault as WBTC vault
    participant Custody_ETH as Custody address
    end
    
    box Binance
    participant WBTC_binance as WBTC balance
    participant BTC_binance as BTC balance
    participant Margined
    participant USDT_binance as USDT balance
    end
    
    box Solana
    participant Solana_multisig
    participant Jupiter_perps
    end

    User->>WBTC_Vault: Deposits WBTC
    WBTC_Vault->>Custody_ETH: Proxies WBTC
    WBTC_Vault->>User: mints maxBTC
    
    Custody_ETH->>WBTC_binance: Transfers WBTC (100% NAV)
    WBTC_binance->>Margined: Opens long BTC 75% (25% NAV)
    WBTC_binance->>USDT_binance: Sells BTC to USDC (75% NAV)
    USDT_binance->>Solana_multisig: Withdraws USDC (70% NAV)
    USDT_binance->>Margined: Provides collateral (5% NAV)
    
    Solana_multisig->>Jupiter_perps: Deposits USDC to the pool
    Jupiter_perps->>Solana_multisig: Mints JLP
    
    Margined->>WBTC_binance: Closes long BTC (25% NAV)
    WBTC_binance->>Margined: Opens SOL/ETH/BTC hedge (25% NAV)
