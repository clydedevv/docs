Security is a core consideration in maxBTC's design. This document outlines the key security measures implemented across the system.

## Multisig Implementation

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Solana Multisig" icon="shield-halved">
    The Solana multisig has a 4/7 threshold with keys geographically distributed. This secures the JLP tokens and ensures no single point of failure.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ethereum Security" icon="shield-halved">
    The WBTC vault utilizes industry-standard security practices, including time-locks and access controls.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Multisig Scope

The multisig is responsible for critical operations:
- Buying/selling JLP tokens
- Token transfers to/from centralized exchanges
- Whitelisting approved addresses
- Approving bot execution permissions

## API Key Management

For CEX integrations:
- IPs are strictly whitelisted
- Trading permissions are minimized to only necessary actions
- Read-only keys are used for monitoring where possible
- Keys are stored securely and rotated regularly

## Bot Security

Automated bot accounts have restricted permissions:
- Limited to specific actions (e.g., rebalancing within predefined parameters)
- Cannot withdraw to unauthorized addresses
- Operations are logged and monitored
- Abnormal activity triggers alerts

## Technical Risk Mitigations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Key Revocability & Management">
    Unlike CEX API keys, Solana private keys cannot be revoked if compromised, requiring a stronger security model with multisig controls and careful key management procedures.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitoring Implementation">
    Our monitoring systems leverage:
    - Real-time price feeds with fallback data sources
    - Automated threshold alerts with escalation paths
    - Position health calculators that run on redundant infrastructure
    - Geographically distributed monitoring nodes
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Smart Contract Security">
    Smart contracts temporarily hold assets only when necessary, minimizing exposure time. All contracts have undergone security audits by independent firms and implement:
    - Time-delay mechanisms for sensitive operations
    - Circuit breakers for unusual activity
    - Role-based access controls
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="System Recovery">
    Recovery protocols are in place to restore operations based on on-chain data and CEX positions in case of system failure, including:
    - Off-site backups of critical configuration
    - Documented recovery procedures
    - Regular recovery drills
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Liquidation Prevention Technical Implementation

To prevent liquidation risk due to significant price movements (as outlined in our <a href="/strategy/risks#key-risk-factors" className="text-blue-500 hover:underline">Risk documentation</a>), we've implemented:

1. A "safety" metric calculator that continuously monitors our LTV based on real-time price data
2. Tiered automated rebalancing triggers at conservative thresholds (30%, 35%, 40% price movements)
3. Multiple independent monitoring systems with automated failover
4. Pre-authorized execution paths for emergency rebalancing when required

## Cross-Chain Security 

The system implements specialized security measures for cross-chain operations:

1. **Message validation**: All cross-chain messages undergo cryptographic verification
2. **Sequencing protection**: Transaction ordering is enforced to prevent attacks
3. **Timeout mechanisms**: Failed cross-chain transactions automatically revert after a safety period
4. **Relayer redundancy**: Multiple independent relayers ensure message delivery
