## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens after the lock-up period?">

    Yes, the minimum deposit amount is 0.5 WBTC (approximately $30,000 at current prices).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I add more WBTC after my initial deposit?">
    Yes, you can make additional deposits at any time during the deposit window, as long as your address has been allowlisted.

  <Accordion title="How is my yield calculated?">
    Yield is calculated in BTC terms, not USD. This means your returns are measured by how much additional BTC you earn, regardless of the USD value of BTC.
