# Private Deposits Overview

MaxBTC is Structured's first tokenized trading strategy, offering holders composable and liquid BTC denominated yield. This document introduces the Private Deposits phase of maxBTC launch.

## Introduction

We are inviting the first partners to the Private Deposits Phase of maxBTC to achieve the following:

- **Build Trust and Transparency:** Initiating an environment with our initial partners that instills confidence and clarity
- **Receive Actionable Feedback:** Better understanding your preferences and requirements so that the protocol can be improved for your needs
- **Build the Community:** Establishing a core community of sophisticated partners who will benefit from early access and contribute to our ability to unlock the opportunity of this new asset class

## Participation Requirements

- **KYC-Gated Access:** Participants need to complete the KYC process to be able to deposit, ensuring regulatory compliance and protecting the integrity of the asset flow.
- **Lock-Up Period:** Deposits made during this phase will be subject to a 3-month lock-up period, ensuring stability and alignment with the protocol's long-term incentives while maintaining operational efficiency.
- **Deposit Asset:** Only WBTC will be accepted for participation in the private deposit phase.
- **Fee Structure:** A whitelisted user deposits WBTC and receives 1:1 maxBTC receipt. **Zero fee** will be applied at minting. The cost of deployment and withdrawals will be reflected in the price of maxBTC.

## Technical Setup

For private deposits (PD), we've created the following setup:

1. A deposit UI that is open to PD participants only, allowing:
   - Depositing WBTC
   - Viewing your deposited balance (spdBTC)
   - Accessing the performance dashboard

2. An Ethereum smart contract that:
   - Accepts WBTC deposits
   - Mints spdBTC (structured private deposits BTC) 1-to-1 to accepted BTC
   - Forwards WBTC deposits straight to the custody

Once all deposits are collected, the team will:
1. Start necessary operations to enter the Jupiter perpetuals pool
