# Risks & Controls

While the maxBTC strategy is designed to be secure and profitable, it's important to understand the potential risks involved and how we mitigate them.

## Key Risk Factors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Liquidation Risk from Extreme Price Movements">
    Short positions in SOL and ETH are used to hedge the passive long exposure to SOL and ETH held through JLP. Liquidation could occur if the price of BTC relative to SOL or ETH drops by approximately 45% before rebalancing.
    
    **Important note:** This is a very low risk, and such a price change has never happened since 2019, based on the available Binance data.
    
    **Control:** Risk is managed through rebalancing automation, insurance fund setup, and adjusting LP/hedging deployment ratios (30-70, 40-60, 50-50) to balance liquidation thresholds and yield impact.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Large Withdrawals and Slippage">
    Withdrawals exceeding $20M may cause significant slippage beyond 0.5%.
    
    **Control:** During the private deposit phase, withdrawals are controlled through the lock-up period. For the full protocol, controlled withdrawal periods and/or withdrawal fees help regulate large outflows and maintain liquidity stability.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Smart Contract Risk">
    Dependence on Jupiter's smart contracts on Solana introduces potential vulnerabilities.
    
    **Control:** Utilizing battle-tested and audited smart contracts mitigates security risks. Our contracts will also undergo comprehensive audits by reputable security firms.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Exchange Risk">
    The insolvency of centralized exchange (CEX) hedging platforms could impact undistributed yield.
    
    **Control:** Principal funds are secured off-exchange through dedicated custodians to minimize counterparty risk. We use Binance for trading operations, which has a proven track record and strong security measures.

## Risk Monitoring System

{/* [IMAGE NEEDED: Add a screenshot or mockup of the risk monitoring dashboard] */}

Our monitoring system includes:

1. **Continuous position monitoring** to ensure sufficient collateral
2. **Automated rebalancing** to maintain optimal ratios between assets
3. **Multi-signature requirements** for all critical operations
4. **Regular audits** of smart contracts and processes

## Asset Security Strategy

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Off-Exchange Custody" icon="vault">
    30% of deposited WBTC is held in off-exchange custody with Ceffu, a leading institutional custodian, for potential Binance collateralization.
  </Card>
  <Card title="On-Chain Transparency" icon="blockchain">
    70% of the deposited WBTC is held on-chain in a Solana multisig wallet in the form of $JLP.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The Solana multisig participants represent geographically distributed key holders that have vast industry experience and contribute actively to DeFi projects and funds.

## Value BTC-Denominated

All calculations for evaluating our strategy's performance are denominated in BTC. This approach ensures that even during market volatility, we maintain a clear focus on BTC-denominated returns.

We value our funds BTC-denominated, but hedge by leveraging long BTC positions with 25% BTC that rests on our Binance account. Thus, if BTC prices rise, we get more BTC on Binance. If BTC prices fall, we get "more" JLP on Solana (compared to what we would get for the amount of BTC we had).

## Additional Risk Considerations

<Warning>
While we have implemented robust risk controls, cryptocurrency investments inherently carry risks. The APY estimates are based on historical performance and may not reflect future results. Please consider your risk tolerance before participating.
