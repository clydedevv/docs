State of the market:
BTCFi lacks real yield
BTC LRT staking yieldis plummeting
BTC vaultslack scale and composability
Tokenized funds are bad liquid assets
Liquid restaking tokens offer liquidity, but:
Staking yield is based on points
Incentives/points campaigns are ending
AVS demand is low

No real yield
BTC vaults offer higher yield, but:
their potential is limited without DeFi integrations
rarely scale beyond 1,000 BTC
entry / exit time and cost are unpredictable
yield tends to be seasonal / volatile

Not liquid, no scale
Hedge funds provide the best possible BTC yields across a portfolio of strategies, but:
their strategies lack the benefits of DeFi composability, e.g. looping
require time lock
normally limited to institutions in certian jurisdictions

Not liquid
How to capture hedge fund type of yield in a liquid asset?

maxBTC: Real Yield for Bitcoin
BTC Price Exposure, BTC Nominated Yield

maxBTC maintains effective 1x long BTC position at all times, and compounds rewards (similar to wstETH)
Infinitely Scalable Across Yield Strategies

maxBTC can capture native BTC yield from multiple sources 
Perfect Building Block for DeFi

maxBTC is optimized for DEX, lending, and yield-splitting integrations

Solution approach:
Infinite strategies, one liquid asset: maxBTC
Network effects of a single asset
Single minting contract
Unified DEX liquidity
DeFi integrations
Channel partner integrations
Insurance fund
Infinite scalability of the underlying real-yield strategies
Every strategy is a vault (on any chain)
Multiple vault managers
Every vault can be called for deposit / withdrawals
Full transparency
Structured is a protocol, NOT a hedge fund
Vault reallocations are managed on-chain
Strategies have individual caps / insurance deposits

What makes maxBTC liquid
DEX liquidity
Automated deposits / withdrawals
In-protocol liquidations
Enables instant entry / exit
Enables liquidations via a DEX
Reduces the risk for the investor
Enables arbitrage
Helps to protect the BTC peg
Helps to keep the entry / exit cost minimal due to smart routing
Enables DeFi integrations, e.g. looping
Critical for lending partners such as Morpho
Allows for better LTV and enables looping at scale

Why now:
A void in the market is opening 
BTC yield is a huge market (~$10B across lending and LRTs, and growing rapidly)
BTC LST yield went down from 8% to 2% recently, creating a huge void in the market waiting for a more sustainable yield source packaged as a liquid asset on-chain
With ETF and CEX perps market growth, BTC real yield sources became scalable

maxBTC GTM Strategy: JLP BTC Neutral
1
Strategy workflow
70% is deployed to a perps market LP pool (e.g., Jupiter etc.)
The other 30% is deployed as collateral to Binance / other CEX platforms:
Short underlying tokens and additional exposure to create delta-neutral exposure to these assets
Leverage long BTC to achieve 1x long BTC position
The hedging position is adjusted regularly
2
Where does the yield come from?
Perps LP fees are generated from opening and closing fees, price impact, borrowing fees, trading fees, and liquidation fees

JLP BTC Neutral:10%+ APY, $500M
Live test since December 24 returned 20% APY.
Expected APY range from 10% (bear market) to 20% (bull market) on ~$500m of capacity
Strategy performs the best when the market crashes, due to the DEX fees increase
5-40% JLP pool yield is converted into BTC yield with 0-4% funding rate cost

Future maxBTC strategies(e.g. CHF carry trade)scale up to $100B at 3-7% APY

GTM Plan:
Build network effects using high-APY launch strategy
‘Come for the tool, stay for the network’
Come for the tool:high BTC APY at the start
DEX liquidity
Lending markets
Yield-splitting
Looping vaults
Stay for the network:omnipresent BTC yield asset
10%+ APY strategy
scalable to $500M
sustainable yield does not depend on funding rates and is protected from market crashes
any chain
any BTC yield source
all key DeFi primitives
