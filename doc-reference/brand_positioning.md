## **Mission**

Bitcoin is one of the world’s most valuable assets – but most of it still sits idle.

Structured’s mission is to unlock real BTC yield: simple to access, transparent by design, and ready to power new use cases. We bring BTC to life on-chain, creating assets that users can hold, build on, and integrate across DeFi.

> **Mission statement** 
– To make real BTC yield liquid, scalable, and ready to build on.
> 

## **Vision**

Structured envisions a future where BTC yield lives natively on-chain – transparent, liquid, and composable.

By enabling real BTC yield as usable collateral, Structured unlocks new layers of lending, building, and growth across DeFi, creating a foundation for the next generation of BTCFi.

> **Vision statement 
–** Our vision is a world where BTC is not just stored but used to power new value across DeFi.

# **Value proposition**

Structured transforms advanced DeFi strategies into a single liquid, tokenized asset that’s simple to hold, use, and build on.

Today, earning BTC yield often means chasing points, rotating assets, or relying on insider access. Structured removes that friction by delivering real yield in a form that integrates natively with DeFi. 

maxBTC is risk-minimized by default, yet composable for users who want more. Whether you loop it, collateralize it, or exit through a DEX – it’s yours, on your terms.

Real BTC yield, packaged as a liquid, scalable asset.

# **Market landscape**

The BTCFi ecosystem is gaining attention, but most BTC-related products still don’t deliver real, sustainable yield. Many rely on speculation, point systems, or inflated TVL. 

BTCFi products currently fall into four main categories:

## **BTC wrappers**

Wrapped BTC tokens are widely used as collateral but do not generate any yield.

- Examples: WBTC, cbBTC, FBTC, TBTC, SolvBTC, SBTC
→ `*No yield*`

## **Issuers and infrastructures**

These enable yield on BTC through various mechanisms:

**BTC L2s** 
These networks aim to scale Bitcoin and unlock DeFi functionality, often offering staking-like yields via native token emissions. Most yields today are token-driven and not yet backed by sustainable on-chain revenue streams.

- **Examples:** Core, Hemi, Corn, bsquare (uBTC), Bouncebit, Merlin, Botanix, BIMA
    
    → `*Mostly token-driven yields, with emerging models that are promising but not yet proven*`
    

**Restaking infrastructures**

Protocols like Babylon introduce BTC restaking, enabling BTC holders to secure other networks and earn rewards through derivative tokens (LSTs). While these mechanisms are technically on-chain, **most yield sources today are tied to points programs or ecosystem bootstrapping incentives**, not realized revenue flows. Risks related to custody, validator behavior, and slashing are also complex and still evolving.

- Examples: Babylon + LSTs such as LBTC, SolvBTC.BBN, pumpBTC, uniBTC (by Bedrock), LorenzoBTC
    
    *→ `Fully on-chain yields, but mainly point-based`*
    

**CEX-integrated LSTs**

Centralized platforms like bfBTC offer BTC yield via proprietary strategies like market making and cross-exchange arbitrage, then issue tokens backed by those assets. Yield is centralized and opaque.

- Example: BitFi (bfBTC)
    
    *→ `Offers centralized yield and on-chain farming`*
    

## **DeFi primitives**

Protocols that offer BTC-based yield through decentralized mechanisms like lending, LPing, perps, and tokenized yield.

- DEXs, lending, perp DEXs, Pendle, and LSTs like yield basis BTC (ex-Curve)
→ *`These offer fully on-chain organic yields, but require active management and often involve risk exposure to altcoins`*

## **Vaults**

Platforms that optimize yield strategies through integrations across DeFi. Offer on-chain yields, but they’re often complex, fragmented, and difficult for most users to follow.

- Examples: Veda, Cian, Concrete
    
    → `On-chain yields, but often manual or semi-manual management`

## The missing corner stone: real yield for BTCFi

Bitcoin is one of the world’s most valuable assets, yet most of it still sits idle. The BTC ETF may have cemented its role in TradFi, but it hasn’t made BTC more usable or productive.

BTCFi is evolving. Projects like Babylon, Bedrock, and Lombard have opened new doors for BTC holders, but most of the space remains fragmented. Yield often depends on token emissions, point schemes, or complex vaults with unclear risks.

BTC still lacks a default yield-bearing asset that anyone can use, build on, or integrate into DeFi.

Structured is here to change that.

---

## **Structured’s entry: maxBTC**

Structured brings real BTC yield to life on-chain, creating the foundation for a scalable, composable financial layer around Bitcoin.

maxBTC is the first liquid BTC asset designed to deliver real, on-chain yield. It combines multiple yield strategies into a single asset that’s simple to use, easy to integrate, and built to scale across DeFi.

It earns yield in BTC, not points. It avoids altcoin exposure and complex vault setups. And it’s built for builders, with clear mechanics and native DeFi compatibility that opens the door to new protocols, use cases, and products.

---

## ***Use cases***

*maxBTC offers its holders several use cases, including:*

- ***HODLing**: Earn sustainable, real BTC yield by simply holding maxBTC in your wallet.*
- *Looping / basis trading (use in DeFi*
- Add use case for builders and strategists

# **Narrative: from broken BTCFi to the Structured path**

| **The broken BTCFi reality** | Bitcoin is one of the most valuable assets in the world, yet most of it still sits idle. Wrapped BTC earns nothing. Native BTC lacks utility. Most yield relies on emissions, point farming, or high-risk vaults with unclear mechanics. |
| --- | --- |
| **The current user journey** | BTC holders who want yield must chase trends, rotate capital, or take on altcoin exposure. It’s manual, resource-intensive, and comes with hidden risks. |
| **Structured introduces a new default** | Structured turns BTC into a productive asset by delivering real, on-chain yield through a liquid format built to scale, integrate, and power new use cases across DeFi. |
| **BTC becomes a building block** | With maxBTC, BTC becomes usable by design – delivering real yield in a liquid format that scales across lending, looping, and new protocol design. |

<aside>

**Narrative call-out (web, decks, one-pagers)**

- Structured turns BTC into a productive asset, delivering real yield on-chain in a liquid format that’s ready to build on.
- maxBTC is the first BTC asset designed for scale – earning real yield while integrating seamlessly with DeFi strategies like lending, looping, and protocol design.
