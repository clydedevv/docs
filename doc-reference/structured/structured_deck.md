maxBTC GTM strategy: JLP delta neutral
1 Strategy workflow
[ 70% is deployed to a perps market LP pool (e.g., Jupiter etc.:
[ The ot her 30% is deployed as collateral to Binance / ot her CEX platformsR
[ Shor t underlying tokens and additional exposure to create delta-neutral exposure to t hese assetJ
[ Leverage long BTC to achieve 1x long BTC positioD
[ The hedging position is adjusted regularly
2 Where does the yield come from?
Perps LP fees are generated from opening and closing fees, price impact, borrowing fees, trading fees, and
liquidation fees
F e b r u a r y , 2 0 2 5

Risks and Controls
i Market dependence for JLP sales: Current ly, we rely on t he open market for selling LP tokens. As we scale up, we aim to become redemption
par tners for Jupiter, which should eliminate t his riska
i Liquidation risk from extreme price movements: Our strategy involves shor t positions in SOL and ETH to counterbalance BTC exposures. This
implies a worst case potential liquidation risk if BTC price falls by ~45% before t he strategy executes rebalancing. (Note t hat BTC has never
experienced a weekly drop exceeding 33.52% since its perpetual listing on Binance in 2019).
This risk can be managed by changing t he LP / hedging deployment ratioe
v 30-70 Deployment: 45% price drop triggers liquidatio"
v 40-60 Deployment: Requires a 66.6% price drop, wit h a yield reduction of 14% compared to t he 30-70 strateg7
v 50-50 Deployment: No liquidation risk but yields are 28% lower compared to t he 30-70 strateg7
i Large wit hdrawals and slippage: Monitoring of t he liquidity pool indicates a capacity of $20M wit hdrawals wit h only 0.3% slippage.
Wit hdrawals larger t han t his may incur significant slippage (can be managed by wit hdrawal period and / or wit hdrawal fees)a
i Smar t contract risk: The strategy involves providing liquidity to t he Jupiter smar t-contracts on Solana, which is batt le-tested and audited.D
i Exchange risk: There's a risk associated wit h t he potential insolvency of CEX hedging platforms. In t he event of t he failure of t he CEX, t he
period’s undistributed yield could be compromised. Principal amounts remain safe as t hey are secured off-exchange by dedicated custodians.
