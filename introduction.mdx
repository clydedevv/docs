# Introduction

Structured is shaping a new standard for Bitcoin yield, turning BTC from a static store of value into a liquid asset that generates sustainable returns and unlocks broader financial utility. maxBTC represents a transparent and composable yield format for Bitcoin, designed to preserve BTC exposure while expanding its role in DeFi.

## **Mission**

**Structured's mission is to deliver real BTC yield that is scalable, composable and liquid by design.** We build yield formats that solve liquidity and complexity challenges, making real yield on Bitcoin accessible and ready to integrate.

## **Vision**

**Structured envisions Bitcoin evolving from a store of value into a trusted asset that powers an open and scalable financial system.** Real BTC yield enables builders and investors to expand what Bitcoin can do, creating growth that is sustainable and built for the long term.

# **Introducing maxBTC**

Built for composability, its LST-like structure makes it compatible with existing DeFi integrations and effective as collateral in lending markets. It lets holders deploy capital without losing BTC exposure, improve capital efficiency, and scale with multiple underlying strategies over time.
