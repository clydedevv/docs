## Our Vision

<Card title="Horizontal Scaling of Tokenized CeDeFi Strategies" className="w-full mb-4">
  <p className="mb-4">While vertical scaling of a single strategy has limitations, our approach packages multiple CeDeFi strategies into liquid assets with LST-like user experience, combining hedge fund returns with the composability and liquidity of tokens.</p>
</Card>

## Why Structured?

<CardGroup cols={2} className="mb-6">
  <Card title="Problem We're Solving" icon="circle-exclamation">
    Most BTC yield options have significant drawbacks:
    
    • Low APR (4-7%)

    • Reliance on unsustainable points/incentives

    • Limited liquidity or composability

    • Significant negative APY risk
  </Card>
  <Card title="Our Approach" icon="lightbulb">
    We provide:
    
    • Higher returns (10-25% APY)

    • Liquid, composable assets

    • Transparent strategy execution
    
    • Real BTC-denominated yield
