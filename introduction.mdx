# Introduction to maxBTC

maxBTC is Structured's first tokenized trading strategy, offering holders composable and liquid BTC-denominated yield. This documentation provides comprehensive information about the strategy, technical implementation, and user guides.

## What is Structured?

Structured addresses an enormous opportunity - tokenizing high-yield strategies so they become accessible, liquid, and composable. As successfully demonstrated by similar projects, even well-known strategies can unlock billions in capital through tokenization.

Built by core contributors to Lido and [P2P.ORG](http://p2p.org/), Structured is pioneering a new asset class that enhances attractive strategies by making them more accessible and composable to unlock new functionality for funds and traders.
