## Problem Statement

<div className="text-sm">
Bitcoin is one of the world's most valuable assets, yet most of it still sits idle. The current BTCFi landscape presents three critical limitations:

  <Card title="Illiquidity" icon="lock" iconType="duotone">
    <div className="text-sm">BTC vaults and hedge funds lock up capital with unpredictable entry/exit windows and costs, limiting usability for DeFi.</div>

  <Card title="No Real Yield" icon="ticket" iconType="duotone">
    <div className="text-sm">BTC LRTs mostly offer unsustainable points-based yield, not genuine BTC returns. Staking yields are plummeting and points campaigns are ending.</div>

  <Card title="Not Scalable" icon="chart-network" iconType="duotone">
    <div className="text-sm">BTC vaults rarely scale beyond 1,000 BTC and lack DeFi composability, limiting their potential for growth and integration.</div>

<div className="text-sm">
maxBTC can be minted on multiple chains (Neutron, Ethereum Mainnet, and more) using wBTC or native BTC deposits. Users can withdraw maxBTC to receive the underlying BTC assets at any time, with a short withdrawal period or through the liquidity pool.

## Market Opportunity

<div className="text-sm">
Perpetual markets have found product-market fit in crypto and are here to stay. These markets fundamentally need liquidity and reward liquidity providers with higher rates than lower-risk options like staking and lending.

However, these liquidity pools lack clear directional exposure to desired assets (e.g., Jupiter JLP pool represents a mix of BTC, ETH, SOL, and USDC/T) and require active management.

maxBTC brings superior yields generated by perpetual markets' liquidity pools to users who prefer clear directional exposure to Bitcoin.
