## Mission

Bitcoin is one of the world's most valuable assets â€“ but most of it still sits idle.

Structured's mission is to unlock real BTC yield: simple to access, transparent by design, and ready to power new use cases. We bring BTC to life on-chain, creating assets that users can hold, build on, and integrate across DeFi.

## The Problem

<div className="text-sm">
The current BTCFi landscape presents three critical limitations:

  <Card title="No Real Yield" icon="ticket" iconType="duotone">
    <div className="text-sm">BTC LRTs mostly offer unsustainable points-based yield, not genuine BTC returns. Staking yields are plummeting from 8% to 2% and points campaigns are ending.</div>

  <Card title="Illiquidity" icon="lock" iconType="duotone">
    <div className="text-sm">BTC vaults and hedge funds lock up capital with unpredictable entry/exit windows and costs, limiting usability for DeFi.</div>
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Not Scalable" icon="chart-network" iconType="duotone">
    <div className="text-sm">BTC vaults rarely scale beyond 1,000 BTC and lack DeFi composability, limiting their potential for growth and integration.</div>

## Introducing maxBTC

**Real Yield for Bitcoin**

<div className="text-sm">
maxBTC is a synthetic, liquid, yield-bearing BTC asset that maintains 1:1 BTC price exposure while generating BTC-denominated yield from proven DeFi strategies. Created by Structured, maxBTC is optimized for DEX, lending, and yield-splitting integrations while maintaining an effective 1x long BTC position that compounds rewards (similar to wstETH).

### Where Does the Yield Come From?

maxBTC's flagship yield strategy generates real BTC-denominated returns through sophisticated DeFi integration with Jupiter's perpetual market liquidity pools. Unlike points-based rewards, this yield comes from actual trading activity and market inefficiencies.

The strategy maintains delta-neutral exposure to everything except BTC while capturing sustainable yield from perpetual market fees and arbitrage opportunities.
