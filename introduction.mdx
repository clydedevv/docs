## The Problem

Despite Bitcoin's dominant role as a digital store of value, much of it still sits idle. Today's BTC DeFi landscape faces key limitations that keep Bitcoin from being a liquid, composable, yield-generating asset.

### Where Does the Yield Come From?

maxBTC's flagship yield strategy generates real BTC-denominated returns through a CeDeFi approach that combines DeFi liquidity provision with centralized exchange hedging. The strategy provides liquidity to Jupiter's perpetual market pools while maintaining BTC exposure through hedged positions on centralized exchanges.

Unlike points-based rewards, this yield comes from actual trading fees collected from the DEX liquidity pools. The strategy maintains directional exposure to BTC while capturing sustainable yield from perpetual market fees through this structured liquidity provision model.
