## Key Risk Factors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Liquidation Risk from Extreme Price Movements">
    Short positions in SOL and ETH are used to hedge the passive long exposure to SOL and ETH held through JLP. Liquidation could occur if the price of BTC relative to SOL or ETH drops by approximately 45% before rebalancing.
    
    **Historical Context:** Since perpetual listing on Binance in 2019, BTC's largest weekly drop was 33.52%, well below our liquidation threshold.
    
    **Controls:**
    - Automated rebalancing triggers at conservative thresholds
    - Insurance fund setup
    - Flexible deployment ratios (30-70, 40-60, 50-50) to balance liquidation thresholds and yield impact
    - Geographic distribution of infrastructure prevents regional outages from affecting operations
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Large Withdrawals and Slippage">
    Withdrawals exceeding $20M may cause significant slippage beyond 0.5%.
    
    **Controls:**
    - Private deposit phase: controlled through lock-up period
    - Full protocol: controlled withdrawal periods and/or withdrawal fees
    - Liquidity monitoring systems with automated alerts
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Smart Contract Risk">
    Dependence on Jupiter's smart contracts on Solana introduces potential vulnerabilities.
    
    **Controls:**
    - Utilizing battle-tested and audited smart contracts
    - Comprehensive audits by reputable security firms
    - Regular code reviews and updates
    - Multiple backup execution pathways for critical operations
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Exchange Risk">
    The insolvency of centralized exchange (CEX) hedging platforms could impact undistributed yield.
    
    **Controls:**
    - Principal funds secured off-exchange through dedicated custodians
    - Using Binance for trading operations (proven track record)
    - Continuous monitoring of exchange health indicators
    - Geographic distribution of infrastructure
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Funding Rate Risk">
    Extremely negative funding rates during market stress could impact returns.
    
    **Controls:**
    - Funding rate impact modeled into risk calculations
    - Position sizing adjustments based on funding rate conditions
    - Ability to adjust strategy parameters during extreme conditions
