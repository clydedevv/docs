## Basic Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is maxBTC and how do I use it?">
    maxBTC is a liquid, yield-bearing BTC asset that maintains 1:1 BTC price exposure while generating sustainable yield targeting ~10% APY at scale. You can:
    
    - **Hold it**: Simply hold maxBTC in your wallet to earn BTC-denominated yield automatically
    - **Use in DeFi**: Use maxBTC as collateral for lending, liquidity provision, or other DeFi strategies
    - **Exit anytime**: Trade maxBTC on DEXs or redeem it for the underlying BTC assets
    
    Unlike traditional BTC vaults or hedge funds, maxBTC gives you instant liquidity and DeFi composability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What makes maxBTC different from other BTC yield products?">
    maxBTC stands out in several key ways:
    
    - **Real yield**: Earns actual BTC-denominated returns (targeting ~10% APY at scale), not points or inflationary tokens
    - **Liquid**: Can be traded on DEXs or used as collateral in DeFi, unlike traditional BTC vaults
    - **Scalable**: Designed to expand across multiple strategies without fragmenting liquidity
    - **Transparent**: All strategy mechanics are public, not a black-box hedge fund approach
    - **Risk-minimized**: Delta-neutral design protects against everything except BTC price movements
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is this safe? What are the main risks?">
    maxBTC is designed with risk-minimization as a priority. For comprehensive risk analysis, see our [Risk Management Framework](/strategy/risks).
    
    **Key safety features:**
    - Delta-neutral to everything except BTC (maintains 1x BTC exposure)
    - Multi-sig security and geographic distribution of key holders
    - Insurance fund support and individual strategy caps
    - BTC would need to drop ~45% relative to other assets before liquidation risk
    
    **Main risks include smart contract, exchange, and strategy risks** - all detailed in our risk documentation.

## Strategy Performance Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why are returns denominated in BTC terms?">
    The JLP Pool APY is **denominated in USD terms** on Jupiter, but **we translate returns back to BTC** for investor convenience. This gives maxBTC holders a clearer picture of their returns in terms of the asset they value most.
  </Accordion>

## Technical Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How is the position actually hedged?">
    The strategy hedges based on:
    1. Actual underlying tokens in the JLP pool
    2. Net position taken by traders against the JLP pool

    We hedge based on real market conditions, not target weightings. For complete technical details, see our [Strategy Overview](/strategy/overview).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the strategy's fees and costs?">
    The strategy incurs several types of fees:
    - **Trading Fees**: When rebalancing positions or executing hedges
    - **Funding Rates**: Paid on perpetual futures positions  
    - **Withdrawal Fees**: When removing liquidity from the JLP pool
    - **Operational Costs**: API calls, gas fees, etc.

    All costs are already accounted for in the reported APY of ~10% at scale.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the strategy's capacity limit?">
    **Current Strategy Capacity**: $500M for JLP BTC Neutral
    
    Limited by:
    - JLP Pool Size (currently $1.75B on Jupiter)
    - Position liquidity requirements
    - Capital efficiency ratios

    For scaling plans beyond this capacity, see our [Horizontal Scaling](/overview/horizontal_scaling) documentation.
