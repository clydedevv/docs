## Basic Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is maxBTC and how do I use it?">
    maxBTC is a liquid, yield-bearing BTC asset that maintains 1:1 BTC price exposure while generating sustainable yield targeting ~10% APY at scale. You can:
    
    - **Hold it**: Simply hold maxBTC in your wallet to earn BTC-denominated yield automatically
    - **Use in DeFi**: Use maxBTC as collateral for lending, liquidity provision, or other DeFi strategies
    - **Exit anytime**: Trade maxBTC on DEXs or redeem it for the underlying BTC assets
    
    Unlike traditional BTC vaults or hedge funds, maxBTC gives you instant liquidity and DeFi composability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I deposit and get maxBTC tokens?">
    Currently, maxBTC is in private deposits phase with selected partners and investors. 
    
    When publicly available (August 2025), you'll be able to:
    1. Deposit wBTC, ETH, USDC, or USDT on Ethereum
    2. Receive maxBTC tokens minted on Neutron
    3. Start earning yield immediately
    
    The process is designed to be simple - just deposit supported assets and receive maxBTC tokens representing your share of the yield-generating strategy.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I withdraw or exit my position?">
    maxBTC offers multiple exit options for maximum flexibility. See our [Liquidity Model](/overview/liquidity) for complete details on:
    
    - **Instant DEX Trading**: Trade maxBTC on decentralized exchanges for immediate exit
    - **Accelerated Orderbook**: Use the 10% buffer on Neutron for instant wBTC at 1-2% premium
    - **Standard Redemption**: Redeem maxBTC for underlying BTC assets with minimal fees
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What makes maxBTC different from other BTC yield products?">
    maxBTC stands out in several key ways:
    
    - **Real yield**: Earns actual BTC-denominated returns (targeting ~10% APY at scale), not points or inflationary tokens
    - **Liquid**: Can be traded on DEXs or used as collateral in DeFi, unlike traditional BTC vaults
    - **Scalable**: Designed to expand across multiple strategies without fragmenting liquidity
    - **Transparent**: All strategy mechanics are public, not a black-box hedge fund approach
    - **Risk-minimized**: Delta-neutral design protects against everything except BTC price movements
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is this safe? What are the main risks?">
    maxBTC is designed with risk-minimization as a priority. For comprehensive risk analysis, see our [Risk Management Framework](/strategy/risks).
    
    **Key safety features:**
    - Delta-neutral to everything except BTC (maintains 1x BTC exposure)
    - Multi-sig security and geographic distribution of key holders
    - Insurance fund support and individual strategy caps
    - BTC would need to drop ~45% relative to other assets before liquidation risk
    
    **Main risks include smart contract, exchange, and strategy risks** - all detailed in our risk documentation.

## Strategy Performance Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the difference between target APY and displayed APY on Jupiter?">
    There are three different APY figures to consider:

    1. **maxBTC Target APY**: ~10% at scale
       - Net BTC-denominated returns after all costs and capital allocation efficiency

    2. **JLP Website Displayed APY**: Often higher (e.g., 40%+)
       - Returns on invested capital only (not accounting for capital efficiency)
       - Only ~70% of capital is deployed, 30% reserved for hedging

    3. **Realized APY**: What you actually receive
       - Accounts for all costs, including funding fees
       - Calculated based on BTC-denominated returns

    For detailed performance breakdown, see our [Strategy Overview](/strategy/overview).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why are returns denominated in BTC terms?">
    The JLP Pool APY is **denominated in USD terms** on Jupiter, but **we translate returns back to BTC** for investor convenience. This gives maxBTC holders a clearer picture of their returns in terms of the asset they value most.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What causes fluctuations in the NAV?">
    NAV fluctuations come from several sources:

    1. **JLP Token Price**: Market-driven fluctuations introduce "noise" to the NAV
    2. **Funding Rate Dynamics**: 
       - Negative funding rates can earn additional yield
       - Positive funding rates are a cost (typical scenario)
    
    We display transparent market value rather than smoothed values so investors can see actual fluctuations.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How is the position actually hedged?">
    The strategy hedges based on:
    1. Actual underlying tokens in the JLP pool
    2. Net position taken by traders against the JLP pool

    We hedge based on real market conditions, not target weightings. For complete technical details, see our [Strategy Overview](/strategy/overview).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the strategy's fees and costs?">
    The strategy incurs several types of fees:
    - **Trading Fees**: When rebalancing positions or executing hedges
    - **Funding Rates**: Paid on perpetual futures positions  
    - **Withdrawal Fees**: When removing liquidity from the JLP pool
    - **Operational Costs**: API calls, gas fees, etc.

    All costs are already accounted for in the reported target APY of ~10% at scale.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are maxBTC's management fees?">
    maxBTC operates with a transparent fee structure:
    
    **Management Fee**: Details to be announced before public launch
    **Performance Fee**: Details to be announced before public launch
    
    All fees will be clearly disclosed and competitive with industry standards. The target APY figures already account for all operational costs, with management fees to be deducted from gross returns.
    
    Fee structure will be finalized and published before the August 2025 public launch.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the strategy's capacity limit?">
    **Current Strategy Capacity**: $500M for JLP BTC Neutral
    
    Limited by:
    - JLP Pool Size (currently $1.75B on Jupiter)
    - Position liquidity requirements
    - Capital efficiency ratios

    For scaling plans beyond this capacity, see our [Horizontal Scaling](/overview/horizontal_scaling) documentation.
