## About maxBTC

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is maxBTC?">

    **Key features:**
    
    - **Real BTC Yield:** Attractive BTC-denominated yield from a portfolio of tested strategies, not emissions

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What makes maxBTC different from other BTC yield products?">
    maxBTC delivers real BTC yield from proven strategies, not emissions. It is liquid and composable for DeFi, scales across multiple strategies without fragmenting liquidity, and offers transparent mechanics with risk controls.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is real yield?">
    **Real yield** refers to returns that are generated from actual, sustainable sources (like trading fees) rather than from inflationary token emissions, points systems, or other artificial incentives.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does maxBTC generate yield?">
    maxBTC generates yield through tested on- and off-chain strategies. The initial strategy underlying maxBTC is based on the Jupiter Liquidity Provider (JLP) pool, which backs leveraged positions on Jupiter Perps and earns fees from trader activity.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How scalable is maxBTC?">
    maxBTC is designed for horizontal scaling. It keeps all liquidity unified in one token while distributing risk and yield across multiple strategies. New strategies can be added without fragmenting liquidity or requiring new tokens.
    
    The minting contract coordinates multiple vaults through a single entry point. Deposits flow into the selected strategy, and all performance aggregates back into maxBTC. This ensures one liquid market and unified DEX liquidity.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is KYC required to mint and redeem maxBTC?">
    KYC is required to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) laws and regulations. Because minting and redeeming involve direct interaction with Structured's vaults, verification protects both participants and the protocol by ensuring assets are not used for illicit purposes. Individuals can complete KYC through [zkMe](https://www.zk.me/faq-list) with ID and proof of address, while entities can onboard through manual verification with the [Structured team](https://t.me/Structured_Contact).

## Strategy & Risk

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the JLP BTC Neutral strategy?">
    It is the first underlying strategy of maxBTC. Capital is allocated into the Jupiter JLP pool while short positions in SOL and ETH hedge non-BTC exposure. It preserves 1× BTC exposure and converts trading activity into BTC-denominated yield.
    
    Learn more: [JLP BTC Neutral Strategy](/strategy/overview)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does the JLP BTC Neutral strategy earn yield?">
    **Fee types:**
    
    - Opening and closing fees on trades
    - Borrowing fees paid by leveraged traders
    - Protocol trading fees
    - Liquidation fees
    
    The strategy allocates capital across two legs: approximately 70% to JLP and 30% as collateral on Ceffu, an institutional custody platform, for hedging on Binance perpetuals. The JLP side earns fees from trader activity, while the hedge neutralizes non-BTC exposure. Positions are rebalanced continuously to track pool composition and trader positioning, converting trading activity into BTC-denominated yield.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the expected returns?">
    The JLP BTC Neutral strategy targets 5–10% BTC-denominated APY, based on historical performance and capacity scaling.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the main risks?">
    Risks include smart contract risk, liquidation risk, exchange risk, funding rate risk, and liquidity and withdrawal risk.
    
    Learn more: [Risk & Controls](/strategy/risks)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How big would a price move need to be to trigger liquidation?">
    Liquidation would require a BTC price drop of around 45% relative to SOL or ETH before rebalancing. Historically, BTC's largest weekly decline since 2019 has been 33.52%, below this threshold.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the strategy's withdrawal capacity?">
    The liquidity pool can support withdrawals in the hundreds of millions of USD with ~0.3% slippage. Larger withdrawals may require scheduling or fees to manage slippage
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are funds safeguarded?">
    Deposits are split between on-chain allocation, which is transparent and verifiable, and off-exchange custody with institutional providers. Funds are only moved to exchanges when required for strategy execution, minimizing counterparty risk.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are underlying funds protected from exchange risk?">
    Underlying funds are protected by limiting exchange exposure to only the unsettled balance from a 24-hour settlement cycle. In practice this balance is held in BTC, representing the net PnL of BTC, SOL, and ETH over the last 24 hours.
    
    About 30% of capital is allocated as collateral for hedging. The full 30% sits on exchange through a custodian, but during a given day 2-4% may remain unsettled. This caps potential exposure if an exchange were to fail before settlement.
