The JLP BTC Neutral strategy generates BTC-denominated yield from trader activity in the Jupiter Liquidity Provider (JLP) pool, while neutralizing non-BTC exposure through perpetual hedging positions on centralized exchanges.

## **Key metrics**

- **Expected return:** 5%-10% BTC-denominated APY
- **Launch:** December 2024
- **Strategy capacity:** Designed for $1B+ at current allocation
- **Risk profile:** Market-neutral with delta hedging
- **Primary yield source:** Jupiter JLP pool fee participation (75% of pool fees)
- **Execution platform:** Jupiter (Solana) + Binance (hedging)
- **Custody:** Ceffu (institutional custody)

**Income sources**

The JLP pool distributes 75% of trading fees to liquidity providers. These include opening/closing fees, borrowing fees, trading fees, and liquidations.

**BTC denomination**

Perpetual futures hedging on Binance offsets SOL and ETH exposure in the pool while keeping the strategy effectively 1× long BTC.

**Ecosystem**

The strategy is built on Jupiter, Solana's main perpetual DEX, which runs with deep liquidity and consistent fee flows.

# **Strategy Implementation**

### Capital Deployment

1. **BTC receipt:** Capital flows into Ceffu institutional custody in BTC/WBTC.
2. **Asset allocation:**
    - 70% → Jupiter JLP Pool (mix of SOL, ETH, WBTC, USDC, USDT)
    - 30% → Binance collateral (held with Ceffu for hedging operations)

### **Delta-neutral positioning**

- Short SOL perpetuals to eliminate SOL exposure
- Short ETH perpetuals to eliminate ETH exposure
- Leveraged long BTC to maintain effective 1× BTC exposure
- Positions rebalanced regularly to track JLP composition changes

### **Yield generation**

- **Primary yield source:** JLP pool fees (75% of trading fees):
    - Opening/closing
    - Borrowing
    - Protocol fees
    - Liquidations
- **Rebalancing alpha:** Additional yield from dynamic hedge adjustments
- **Funding rate management:** Costs typically in the -1% to -4% range, occasionally positive

# Risk Management

- Automated rebalancing systems maintain delta-neutral exposure
- 70% fund in a smart contract
- Approximately, 30% collateral in Ceffu and 24hr settlement insures only collateral required for hedging transferred to Binance

# **Historical Performance**

- **Private Beta Performance:** 5%-10% BTC-denominated APY (June 2025)
- **Market conditions:** Performance typically improves during volatile periods as trading fees increase
