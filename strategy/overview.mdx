## Strategy Workflow

The JLP BTC Neutral strategy deploys capital in a 70/30 split:

<img src="/images/howMaxBTCWorks.png" alt="JLP BTC Neutral Strategy Flow" className="w-full rounded-lg my-4" />

1. **70% to Jupiter JLP pool**: Capital is deployed to a mix of SOL, ETH, BTC, USDC, and USDT in the pool
2. **30% to hedging positions**: Used as collateral at centralized venues to:
   - Short ETH, SOL to neutralize non-BTC exposure
   - Leverage long BTC to maintain effective 1:1 BTC price exposure

## APY Breakdown

<img src="/images/strategyAPYBreakdown.png" alt="Strategy APY Breakdown" className="w-full rounded-lg my-4" />

- **Expected APY:** 10% (bear market) to 20% (bull market)
- **Strategy Capacity:** $500M
- **Pool Yield:** 5-40% JLP pool yield converted to BTC with 0-4% funding rate cost
- **Market Conditions:** Performance typically improves during market crashes due to increased DEX fees

Future maxBTC strategies (e.g., CHF carry trade) will scale up to $100B+ at 3-7% APY.

## Strategy Advantages

  <Card title="Market-Neutral Design" icon="scale-balanced" iconType="duotone">

  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Automated Rebalancing" icon="arrows-rotate" iconType="duotone">
    Positions are automatically rebalanced to accurately reflect changes in the JLP pool composition and the net open position of all traders.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Capture of Market Volatility" icon="chart-line-up" iconType="duotone">
    The strategy actually benefits from market volatility through increased trading fees in the Jupiter pool and higher opportunities for rebalancing arbitrage.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Sustainable Yield Source" icon="seedling" iconType="duotone">
    Unlike points-based rewards or temporary incentives, this yield comes from real trading activity and market inefficiencies that are inherent to crypto markets.

## Risk Management

- **Delta-Neutral Position**: The strategy is delta-neutral to everything except BTC, insulating it from price movements in other assets.
- **Liquidation Protection**: BTC price would need to drop ~45% in a short time period to trigger liquidation, providing substantial safety margin.
