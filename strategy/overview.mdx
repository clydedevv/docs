## Strategy Workflow

The JLP BTC Neutral strategy deploys capital in a 70/30 split:

<img src="/images/howMaxBTCWorks.png" alt="JLP BTC Neutral Strategy Flow" className="w-full rounded-lg my-4" />

1. **70% to Jupiter JLP pool**: Capital is deployed to a mix of SOL, ETH, BTC, USDC, and USDT in the pool
   - Generates yield through trading fees, liquidations, and price impact
   - Automatically compounds returns within the pool
2. **30% to hedging positions**: Used as collateral at centralized venues (Binance) to:
   - Short ETH, SOL to neutralize non-BTC exposure
   - Leverage long BTC to maintain effective 1:1 BTC price exposure

## Strategy Advantages

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Market-Neutral Design" icon="scale-balanced" iconType="duotone">
    The strategy is deliberately designed to be neutral to all market movements except BTC, maintaining an effective 1x long BTC position regardless of market conditions.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Automated Rebalancing" icon="arrows-rotate" iconType="duotone">
    Positions are automatically rebalanced to accurately reflect changes in the JLP pool composition and the net open position of all traders.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Capture of Market Volatility" icon="chart-line-up" iconType="duotone">
    The strategy actually benefits from market volatility through increased trading fees in the Jupiter pool and higher opportunities for rebalancing arbitrage.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Sustainable Yield Source" icon="seedling" iconType="duotone">
    Unlike points-based rewards or temporary incentives, this yield comes from real trading activity and market inefficiencies that are inherent to crypto markets.
