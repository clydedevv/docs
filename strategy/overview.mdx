# maxBTC Strategy Overview

maxBTC is a yield-bearing synthetic asset that represents an effective 1x long BTC position while generating attractive yields through a carefully managed strategy.

## The Core Strategy

<Card title="Yield Generation Approach" className="w-full">
  <div>
    The BTC deployed by users is managed in the following way:
    
    - **70%** is deployed to [Jupiter JLP pool](https://jup.ag/perps-earn) on Solana
    - **30%** is deployed as collateral to Binance, where:
      - Short ETH and SOL positions create delta-neutral exposure to these assets
      - Leveraged long positions on BTC achieve an effective 1x long BTC exposure
  </div>
</Card>

The strategy is automatically rebalanced based on:
- Changes in JLP pool composition
- Net open positions of traders within the pool

## Yield Sources

maxBTC generates yield from multiple sources:

  <Card title="JLP Pool Fees" icon="coins">
    75% of fees generated from trading operations (opening/closing positions, price impact, borrowing fees, etc.) are distributed to JLP holders.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rebalancing Arbitrage" icon="scale-balanced">
    Rebalancing positions when JLP trades at a discount or premium relative to its BTC valuation, typically yielding ~0.5% annually.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Funding Rate Dynamics" icon="chart-line">
    While typically a cost, funding rates can become positive during extreme market conditions, providing additional yield protection.
  </Card>

## Expected Performance

Based on our 90-day proof of concept with mainnet assets, the maxBTC strategy achieved:
- **25% average APY** (during a period of high market volatility)
- **Rolling 30-day average APY** typically fluctuated between 10% and 40%

We expect long-term APY to stabilize in the 10-20% range over time, depending on market conditions.

## Competitive Advantages

  <Card title="Higher Yield Potential" icon="arrow-trend-up">
    2-3x higher APY compared to other BTC-denominated yield opportunities (which typically offer 5-7%)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Native BTC Yield" icon="bitcoin-sign">
    Unlike other solutions that only provide points or governance tokens, maxBTC delivers yield directly in BTC terms
  </Card>
  <Card title="DeFi Composability" icon="puzzle-piece">
    maxBTC can be used as collateral to generate additional yield or hedging opportunities

## Market Opportunity

{/* [IMAGE NEEDED: A comparison chart of BTC yield options] */}

Current on-chain BTC yield market is over $4B, including:
- $3.5B wBTC market on Aave
- $200M+ Pendle BTC pools
- Other smaller platforms

Existing BTC yield options are limited:
- BTC LRTs offer only points-based yield
- BTC vaults generate up to 5-7% APY but lack composability
- Both options provide relatively low APR compared to maxBTC

## Target Users

The maxBTC strategy is particularly suitable for:
- BTC whales who are active in DeFi
- Liquid funds looking for enhanced BTC-denominated returns 
- Long-term BTC holders seeking additional yield
- DeFi users wanting to use yield-bearing BTC as collateral
