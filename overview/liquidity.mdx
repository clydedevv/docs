Liquidity is a cornerstone of maxBTC's design. Unlike traditional BTC vaults or hedge funds that lock capital with unpredictable exit windows, maxBTC is built from the ground up to enable instant entry and exit options.

### Network effects of a single asset

maxBTC creates powerful network effects through a unified approach:

- **Single Minting Contract**: All maxBTC tokens originate from one central minting contract, ensuring consistency and standardization.
- **Unified DEX Liquidity**: Concentrates liquidity in a single asset rather than fragmenting across multiple tokens, creating deeper markets.
- **DeFi Integrations**: A single liquid asset simplifies integration across lending platforms, yield aggregators, and other DeFi protocols.
- **Channel Partner Integrations**: Partners can easily integrate with one standardized asset rather than multiple yield strategies.
- **Automated Deposits/Withdrawals**: Streamlined process for capital movement
- **Arbitrage**: Helps protect the BTC peg and keeps entry/exit costs minimal
- **Instant Entry/Exit**: DEX liquidity enables immediate trading without waiting for redemption cycles

## Accelerated Orderbook Mechanism

maxBTC maintains a 10% buffer on Neutron that enables users to exit positions instantly without waiting for standard 24-hour redemption cycles. This mechanism uses Duality's orderbook to provide atomic execution, better pricing through aggregated liquidity, and cross-chain accessibility.
