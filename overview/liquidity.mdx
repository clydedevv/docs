---

maxBTC is designed around liquidity as its core capability. There are three components of liquidity that are supported by maxBTC's design:

- **Short deposit and withdrawal times** of the underlying strategies due to full automation across smart contract, custody, and CEX perps markets components. These are critical for enabling efficient DEX arbitrage and peg protection for maxBTC.
- **In-protocol liquidations** using instant withdrawals of the underlying strategies and protocol's liquidity buffer in the future. Critical for the lending markets, this feature enables higher lending caps for maxBTC and increased usability as collateral.
- **Secondary DEX liquidity** enables instant exit from a maxBTC position. maxBTC price on a DEX can be maintained around the redemption rate ('peg protection') due to the short withdrawal period.
