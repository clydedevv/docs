Liquidity is a cornerstone of maxBTC's design. Unlike traditional BTC vaults with manual processes and unpredictable exit windows, maxBTC features fully automated withdrawals with guaranteed processing times - the foundation that enables all advanced liquidity features.

**Full DeFi ecosystem from day one** - maxBTC launches with complete liquidity infrastructure including market makers, vault managers, lending integrations, and cross-chain accessibility.

## Exit Options

maxBTC provides three ways to exit your position:

1. **Instant DEX Trading**: Trade on decentralized exchanges like Duality for immediate exit
2. **Standard Redemption**: Redeem for underlying BTC assets with minimal fees  
3. **In-Protocol Liquidation**: Automated underlying BTC redemption through limit orders and cross-chain routing

## What Makes This Unique

maxBTC's exit mechanisms enable true DeFi composability, unlocking tangible benefits for users:

- **Predictable withdrawal times and costs** - No uncertainty around exit timing or fees
- **Instant DEX liquidity** - Trade immediately when market opportunities arise  
- **Leveraged looping strategies** - Use maxBTC with lending protocols to amplify BTC exposure
- **Universal collateral** - Deploy maxBTC as collateral across lending protocols and perps trading
- **Higher LTV ratios** - In-protocol liquidations enable lending protocols to offer better terms

Built for composability from day one, maxBTC transforms how users interact with BTC in DeFi - from simple holding to sophisticated yield and leverage strategies.
