Liquidity is a cornerstone of maxBTC's design. Unlike traditional BTC vaults or hedge funds that lock capital with unpredictable exit windows, maxBTC is built from the ground up to enable instant entry and exit options.

**Full DeFi ecosystem from day one** - maxBTC launches with complete liquidity infrastructure including market makers, vault managers, lending integrations, and cross-chain accessibility.

## Exit Options

maxBTC provides three ways to exit your position:

1. **Instant DEX Trading**: Trade on decentralized exchanges like Duality for immediate exit
2. **Standard Redemption**: Redeem for underlying BTC assets with minimal fees  
3. **Accelerated Orderbook**: Instant wBTC redemption through automated limit orders and cross-chain routing

## What Makes This Unique

Unlike traditional BTC vaults with unpredictable exit windows, maxBTC provides multiple exit mechanisms that ensure instant liquidity for any position size. Built for composability from day one - use maxBTC as collateral, in lending protocols, or for yield strategies. The accelerated orderbook enables large liquidations and position management for vault managers and money markets.
