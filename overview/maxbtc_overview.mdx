# MaxBTC Overview

Based on the 90 days POC with main net assets, maxBTC strategy achieved **25% average APY**. Rolling 30 days average APY typically fluctuated between 10% and 40%.

The strategy benefited from market volatility during December '24 - March '25 and we expect the APY to stabilize at 10%-20% range over time.

## Strategy APY Breakdown

  <Card title="JLP APY" icon="chart-line">
    Generated from fees accrued through Jupiter's perpetual trading activitiesâ€”including fees for opening/closing positions, price impact, borrowing, and trading. These fees are redistributed to JLP holders on an hourly basis, resulting in an APY that typically ranges from high single-digit percentages to as much as 40%.

  <Card title="Hedging APY" icon="shield-halved">
    Generated by rebalancing positions whenever the JLP trades at a discount or premium relative to its BTC valuation. Typically, this process yields a positive annual return of approximately 0.5%.

  <Card title="Funding Rate Cost" icon="money-bill-trend-up">
    Arises from hedging positions on centralized exchanges (CEXs). Historically, this rate has ranged between -1% and -4%, but during extreme market conditions, it can become positive, thereby contributing an extra layer of APY protection.
