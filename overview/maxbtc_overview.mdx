## Strategy Overview

<Card title="How it Works" className="w-full">
  <div>
    The BTC deployed by users is managed in the following way:
    
    - **70%** is deployed to [Jupiter JLP pool](https://jup.ag/perps-earn) on Solana
    - **30%** is deployed as collateral to Binance, where:
      - Short ETH and SOL positions create delta-neutral exposure to these assets
      - Leveraged long positions on BTC achieve an effective 1x long BTC exposure
  </div>
</Card>

## Where Does the Yield Come From?

maxBTC generates yield from three primary sources:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="JLP Pool Fees" icon="coins">
    75% of fees generated from trading operations (opening/closing positions, price impact, borrowing fees, etc.) are distributed to JLP holders, typically contributing 15-35% of total yield
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rebalancing Arbitrage" icon="scale-balanced">
    Rebalancing positions when JLP trades at a discount or premium relative to its BTC valuation, typically yielding ~0.5% annually
  </Card>
  <Card title="Funding Rate Management" icon="chart-line">
    Usually a cost of 1-4%, but can occasionally be positive during extreme market conditions, providing additional yield protection
  </Card>

## Historical Performance

Based on a 90-day proof of concept with mainnet assets, the maxBTC strategy achieved a **25% average APY**. The rolling 30-day average APY typically fluctuated between 10% and 40%. The strategy benefited from market volatility during the proof of concept period, and we expect the APY to stabilize at a 10-20% range over time.

## Expected Performance

During bull market conditions, we anticipate the strategy to achieve 15-20% APY, while in bear markets, returns typically range from 10-15% APY. Our target is an average of approximately 18% APY with a Sharpe ratio exceeding 2.5.
