## Liquidity Architecture

<Card title="Intelligent Exit Routing" icon="route" className="w-full mb-6">
  <p className="mb-3">Most BTC yield strategies require unwinding complex positions for users to exit, creating significant friction. maxBTC solves this with:</p>
  
  <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
    <li>Multi-venue exit routing that optimizes costs based on current network conditions</li>
    <li>Smart order routing that distributes withdrawal transactions to minimize slippage</li>
    <li>Automated conversion between assets to find the optimal exit path</li>
    <li>Proprietary slippage mitigation algorithms for large withdrawals</li>
  </ul>

## Cross-Chain Compatibility

<CardGroup cols={2} className="mb-6">
  <Card title="Multi-Chain Presence" icon="globe">
    <p className="mb-2">maxBTC is designed to be available on multiple chains simultaneously:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
      <li>Ethereum for wide DeFi integration and institutional access</li>
      <li>Neutron for efficient issuance and redemption processes</li>
      <li>Future expansion to additional EVM chains based on demand</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>

  <Card title="Cross-Chain Liquidity" icon="bolt">
    <p className="mb-2">Our approach optimizes for cross-chain efficiency:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
      <li>IBC transfers between Cosmos-based chains for fast, low-cost transfers</li>
      <li>Unified liquidity management across different chain deployments</li>
      <li>Bridge-agnostic design that can adapt to the optimal cross-chain solutions</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Secondary Market Advantages

<Card title="Market-Making & Price Discovery" icon="coins" className="w-full mb-6">
  <p className="mb-3">
    Unlike traditional BTC yield solutions where users must wait for withdrawal processes, maxBTC's tokenized approach enables efficient secondary market activity:
  </p>
  
  <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
    <li>AMM pools can facilitate instant trading of maxBTC positions</li>
    <li>Price discovery mechanism captures both NAV and market sentiment</li>
    <li>Arbitrage opportunities help maintain price stability relative to intrinsic value</li>
    <li>Secondary market transactions completely bypass withdrawal processes</li>
  </ul>
</Card>
