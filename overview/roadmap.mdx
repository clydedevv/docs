## Long-term Vision

Beyond these initial milestones, maxBTC aims to:

- Become the default BTC yield asset in DeFi, replacing points-based LRTs and low-yield alternatives
- Expand to a full suite of assets beyond BTC (maxETH, etc.)
- Enable true cross-chain composability for yield-bearing assets
- Create a platform for external strategies to plug into the infrastructure
- Develop advanced governance for risk management and strategy selection
