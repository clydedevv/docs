The Structured Points program tracks user activity across vaults and integrations, creating a transparent system of progression for early participants. Points are displayed in a dedicated dashboard with ranking and leaderboard features, updated weekly.

## Safeguards

To ensure fairness for all participants:

- Thresholds and weighting prevent small balance splitting.
- Referral rewards are structured to benefit the referred user directly.
- All mechanics are applied consistently across users.

## Tiers

As activity grows, points accumulate into tiers. These tiers reflect long-term engagement and create progression for participants. The structure will expand over time, with initial levels already live:

| **Stone** | **Copper** | **Future tiers**  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Entry tier for users who deposit, no boost multiplier. | After two months of deposited activity, applies a 1.1Ã— boost multiplier. | Additional tiers will follow as the program expands. |

All points and rankings are visible to participants. A leaderboard highlights top contributors, while individual dashboards track balances and tier status.

## **Multipliers**

Multipliers vary by strategy and integration. For example, using maxBTC as collateral, providing liquidity in Supervaults, or holding specific LP tokens can earn higher points.
