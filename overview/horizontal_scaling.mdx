Unlike traditional BTC yield products that are limited by strategy capacity, maxBTC is designed for horizontal scaling across multiple strategies and chains, enabling virtually unlimited growth potential.

## The Scaling Problem

## Single Asset, Infinite Strategies Architecture

**Unified Asset, Multiple Strategies**

maxBTC maintains a single liquid asset while distributing risk and yield generation across multiple underlying strategies:

- JLP BTC Neutral & Future Perps Based strategies ($500M+ capacity)
- Future TradFi strategies ($100B+ potential)
- External vault providers & strategy managers

**How It Works**

The maxBTC minting contract forms the core of our horizontal scaling approach, creating powerful network effects through a unified architecture:

- **Single Point of Entry**: All maxBTC tokens originate from one central minting contract, managing multiple underlying vaults through a standardized interface
- **Unified DEX Liquidity**: Concentrates liquidity in a single asset rather than fragmenting across multiple tokens, creating deeper markets
- **Optimized Capital Allocation**: Automatically distributes capital across strategies based on yield and risk parameters
- **DeFi Integrations**: Simplifies integration across lending platforms, yield aggregators, and other DeFi protocols
- **Modular Vault Architecture**: Each yield strategy operates as an independent vault that can exist on any chain while contributing to the same maxBTC token
