description: "How maxBTC achieves infinite scalability across strategies and chains"
---

Unlike traditional BTC yield products that are limited by strategy capacity, maxBTC is designed for horizontal scaling across multiple strategies and chains, enabling virtually unlimited growth potential.

## The Scaling Problem

Traditional BTC yield approaches face several scaling limitations:

- **Strategy Saturation**: Single strategies (like LRTs or individual vaults) quickly reach capacity limits
- **Chain Constraints**: Solutions limited to one blockchain cannot tap into cross-chain opportunities
- **Network Fragmentation**: Multiple tokens for different strategies fragment liquidity and reduce utility

## maxBTC's Horizontal Scaling Solution

  <Card title="Unified Asset, Multiple Strategies" icon="diagram-project">
    maxBTC maintains a single liquid asset while distributing risk and yield generation across multiple underlying strategies:
    
    • JLP BTC Neutral ($500M capacity)
    
    • Future TradFi strategies ($100B+ potential)

    • Cross-exchange arbitrage opportunities

    • Multi-chain yield sources
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Architectural Advantages" icon="cubes">
    The system is built for infinite scalability through:

    
    • Single minting contract with unified liquidity 
    
    • Modular vault architecture with individual caps
    
    • Multiple vault managers (both internal and external)
    
    • Cross-chain interoperability
    
    • Insurance fund for risk management

## Minting Contract Architecture

<img src="/images/maxBTCmintingContract.png" alt="maxBTC Minting Contract Architecture" className="w-full rounded-lg mb-4" />

The maxBTC minting contract forms the core of our horizontal scaling approach. It:

- Acts as a single point of entry for deposits and minting
- Manages multiple underlying vaults through a standardized interface
- Optimizes capital allocation across strategies based on yield and risk parameters
- Maintains a unified token representation regardless of the underlying yield source

## Strategy Expansion Process

As maxBTC grows, new strategies can be integrated through a defined governance process:

1. **Strategy Proposal**: New yield strategies are proposed and technically vetted
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluation of risk parameters, including correlation with existing strategies
3. **Capacity Allocation**: Each approved strategy receives an allocation cap
4. **Gradual Integration**: New strategies are introduced with conservative caps that increase with proven performance
