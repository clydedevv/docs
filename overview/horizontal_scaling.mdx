# **Architecture**

**One asset, infinite strategies.**

maxBTC achieves horizontal scaling by maintaining a single liquid asset while distributing risk and yield generation across multiple underlying strategies. This layered design allows strategies with different profiles to be added while keeping all liquidity unified in maxBTC.

- **Single minting contract**: maxBTC is minted through one contract, with each strategy contributing to the same liquid asset
- **Unified liquidity**: each strategy outputs the same maxBTC token, concentrating liquidity in a single market
- **Modular vaults**: strategies can be added independently, with returns aggregated into maxBTC

## **How it works**

The minting contract forms the core of the scaling approach, coordinating multiple vaults through a standardized interface:

- **Single point of entry**: one minting path for maxBTC across all strategies
- **Vault allocation**: user deposits are allocated into the selected strategy
- **Yield aggregation**: strategy performance flows back into the same maxBTC token
- **Unified DEX liquidity**: deeper markets in a single asset rather than fragmented tokens
