# User Interfaces

You can use Neutron DEX by directly crafting [DEX messages](/neutron/modules/dex/messages) and sending them through transactions in your own scripts, but you can also use various user interfaces to interact with the Dex.

We are working with several partners in the Neutron [ecosystem](https://app.neutron.org/ecosystem) (such as [Astroport](https://app.astroport.fi)) that use Neutron DEX and by using these applications you can benefit from the Dex's features. We also provide a UI as described here in the Neutron app for placing orders on the DEX.

## Neutron app

### Orderbook

The Neutron app orderbook is available at [app.neutron.org/orderbook](https://app.neutron.org/orderbook)

Here for each token pair you can see a live price chart as well as the current liquidity depth and recent trades, and your history of your own recent trades. Using these tools you can place an advanced **Buy** or **Sell** order using the Limit Order card. Here you can select the [order type](/neutron/modules/dex/messages#place-limit-order) you want to use and set its specific options such as how long the order should remain in the market (if relevant).

The charting technology is provided by [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/), a platform for traders and investors. It offers advanced charting tools so that you can plan your trade with the context of your own saved notes and measurements, and other features such as major upcoming events in the [TradingView economic calendar](https://www.tradingview.com/economic-calendar/).

#### Portfolio Balance
In the sidebar you can view your current asset balances on the Neutron chain.

### Bridge

The Neutron app bridge is available at [app.neutron.org/bridge](https://app.neutron.org/bridge)

This is where you can bring tokens from other chains onto the Neutron chain for trading on the Dex.

You can see the amount of tokens you currently hold on the Neutron chain and bring more tokens into the Neutron chain or withdraw them out of the Neutron chain.
