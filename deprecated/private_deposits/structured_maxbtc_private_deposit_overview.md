# **Introduction to Structured**

Structured addresses an enormous opportunity - tokenizing high yield strategies so they can become accessible, liquid, and composable. As successfully demonstrated by Ethena, even well-known strategies can unlock billions in capital through tokenization. However, there are 100s more strategies worth unlocking the same utility that tokenization provides, if only there was a venue that would enable that.  

Enter Structured. Built by core contributors to Lido, [P2P.ORG](http://p2p.org/), Structured is pioneering a new asset class that enhances attractive strategies by making them more accessible and composable to unlock new functionality for funds and traders.

# **MaxBTC Overview**

Structured is starting with the mother of all crypto tokens - BTC. maxBTC, the first asset launched by Structured, generates BTC denominated yield from Perpetual LP-ing and Funding Rates arbitrage, averaging ~**25% APY** during 3-month on-chain pilot. Overtime more BTC strategies will be brought to market to increase the capacity and utility of maxBTC.

# Max BTC Private Deposits

We are inviting the first partners to the Private Deposits Phase of maxBTC to achieve the following:

- **Build Trust and Transparency :** Initiating an environment with our initial partners that instills confidence and clarity
- **Receive Actionable Feedback:** Better understanding your preferences and requirements  so that the protocol can be improved for your needs
- **Build the Community:** Establishing a core community of sophisticated partners who will benefit from early access and contribute to our ability to unlock the opportunity of this new asset class

# Historical APY Performance

Based on the 90 days POC with main net assets, maxBTC strategy achieved **25% average APY**. Rolling 30 days average APY typically fluctuated between 10% and 40%.

The strategy benefited from market volatility during December â€˜24 - March â€˜25 and we expect the APY to stabilize at 10%-20% range over time.

Strategy APY Breakdown:

- JLP APY: is generated from fees accrued through Jupiter's perpetual trading activitiesâ€”including fees for opening/closing positions, price impact, borrowing, and tradingâ€”while excluding asset appreciation and traders' PnL. These fees are redistributed to JLP holders on an hourly basis, resulting in an APY that typically ranges from high single-digit percentages to as much as 40%.
- Hedging APY: is generated by rebalancing positions whenever the JLP trades at a discount or premium relative to its BTC valuation. Typically, this process yields a positive annual return of approximately 0.5%.
- The funding rate cost: arises from hedging positions on centralized exchanges (CEXs). Historically, this rate has ranged between -1% and -4%, but during extreme market conditions, it can become positive, thereby contributing an extra layer of APY protection.

Sharpe Ratio:

- use AAVE supplying rate as the risk free rate (~0.03%)
- Average APY: ~25%
- Standard Deviation: ~9.64%
- Sharpe Ratio: ~2.5

# Asset Flow & Security Highlights

- **Eligible Deposit Asset:** Only WBTC will be accepted for participation in the private deposit phase.
- **Off Exchange Custody:** Deposited WBTC is strategically allocated with 30% held in off-exchange custody with Ceffu, a leading institutional custodian, for potential Binance collateralization. Collateral is transferred between custody and exchanges ONLY when required to settle funding obligations or realized P&L.
- **On-Chain Transparency:**  70% of the deposited WBTC is held on-chain in a Solana multisig wallet in the form of $JLP. The Solana multisig participants represent geographically distributed key holders that have vast industry experience and contribute actively to DeFi projects and funds.

# Key Participation Details

- **KYC-Gated Access:** Participants need to complete the KYC process to be able to deposit, ensuring regulatory compliance and protecting the integrity of the asset flow.
- **Lock-Up Period:** Deposits made during this phase will be subject to a 3-month lock-up period, ensuring stability and alignment with the protocolâ€™s long-term incentives while maintaining operational efficiency.
- **Fee Structure:** A whitelisted user deposits WBTC and receives 1:1 maxBTC receipt. **Zero fee** will be applied at minting. The cost of deployment and withdrawals will be reflected in the price of maxBTC.

# **Benefits for Early Participants**

- **Potential for Enhanced Early-Adopter Yield:** Access generally higher APY rates during this exclusive phase due to less saturation, rewarding early commitment.
- **Exclusive Strategic Insights and Direct Engagement:** Gaining early access to the core team and general strategic direction. Your input will contribute to shaping the future direction of the protocol.
- **Preferred Access to Future Opportunities:** Secure priority access to future deposit opportunities and preferential treatment in subsequent investment rounds, positioning you at the forefront of MaxBTC's development and scaling.

# Risks & Controls

- **Liquidation Risk from Extreme Price Movements:** Short positions in SOL and ETH are used to hedge the passive long exposure to SOL and ETH held through JLP. Liquidation could occur if the price of BTC relative to SOL or ETH drops by approximately 45% *before rebalancing*. Important note: this is a very low risk, and such a price change has never happened since 2019, based on the available Binance data.
    - Control: Risk is managed through rebalancing automation, insurance fund setup, and adjusting LP/hedging deployment ratios (30-70, 40-60, 50-50) to balance liquidation thresholds and yield impact.
- **Large Withdrawals and Slippage:** Withdrawals exceeding $20M may cause significant slippage beyond 0.5%.
    - Control: Controlled withdrawal periods and/or withdrawal fees help regulate large outflows and maintain liquidity stability. Additionally, withdrawals can be routed via different venues and different assets to optimize total withdrawal cost.
- **Smart Contract Risk:** Dependence on Jupiterâ€™s smart contracts on Solana introduces potential vulnerabilities.
    - Control: Utilizing battle-tested and audited smart contracts mitigates security risks.
- **Exchange Risk:** The insolvency of centralized exchange (CEX) hedging platforms could impact undistributed yield.
    - Control: Principal funds are secured off-exchange through dedicated custodians to minimize counterparty risk.
