## Strategy Overview

<Card title="Multi-Strategy Approach" className="w-full mb-4">
  <div>
    maxBTC is designed to incorporate multiple yield-generating strategies over time, allowing for diversification and yield generation based on market conditions. Strategies are dynamically and automatically deployed by smart contracts to generate BTC-denominated returns while managing risk.
    
    Our initial strategy deployment is focused on the JLP Delta Neutral strategy, with additional strategies planned for future versions of maxBTC.

## Historical Performance

Based on a 90-day proof of concept with mainnet assets, the maxBTC strategy achieved a **25% average APY**. The rolling 30-day average APY typically fluctuated between 10% and 40%. The strategy benefited from market volatility during the proof of concept period, and we expect the APY to stabilize at a 10-20% range over time.
