# maxBTC Server Architecture

This server implements a comprehensive JLP (Jupiter Liquidity Provider) token strategy execution system. The architecture is based on microservices that coordinate to manage portfolio exposure, execute trades, and maintain collateral requirements.

## System Overview

The system relies on two primary sources of truth:

1. **On-chain and Exchange Data**: Real-time information from blockchain networks and exchanges
2. **Persistent Database**: MongoDB collections that track system state and history

## Microservices *(Placeholder section, do we want this?)*

The server consists of 6 core microservices plus auxiliary components:
