This maxBTC Mint User Agreement (this "Agreement") is a contract between you ("you" or a " Mint User") and Bondhive Limited ("referred to as the "Company," and  "Bondhive", "we," or "us") related products and services (the "Services") on the Company platform (the "Platform" or "Company"). In addition to this Agreement, the maxBTC Terms and Conditions apply to your maxBTC tokens ("maxBTC") and your status as a Mint User, as applicable, as defined in the maxBTC Terms. From and after the date set forth above, this Agreement shall govern your use of any Company products or Services.

For the avoidance of doubt, your access to the Services, Platform, and maxBTC is contingent on your status as a Mint User and any eligibility requirements, as defined and set forth herein. These requirements are subject to change.

By registering as a Mint User or using any of the Services, you agree that you have read, understood and accept all of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and the **maxBTC Disclaimers and Risks Notice** as well as the **Privacy Notice** attached to this Agreement as **Addendum 1,** the **Terms of Service** attached as **Addendum 2**, the **Risk Disclosure Statement** attached as **Addendum 3**, and any other applicable terms and policies, and you acknowledge and agree that you will be bound by these terms and conditions.

Note that this Agreement uses the term "Digital Currency" to refer to maxBTC or any other digital currencies, cryptocurrencies, virtual currencies, or digital assets. For the avoidance of doubt, where used herein, the term "funds" includes Digital Currency.

**Please note that Section 20 contains an arbitration clause and collective or class action waiver.  By agreeing to this Agreement, you agree to resolve all disputes, except as otherwise set forth in Section 20, through binding individual arbitration, which means that you waive any right to have the dispute decided by a judge or jury, and you waive any right to participate in collective action, whether that be a class action, class arbitration, or representative action.**

1. **Eligibility; Limitations; Registration Process; Identity Verification Eligibility; Limitations**

The Platform and the Services are currently only available to users located in supported jurisdictions. In registering to use the Company Services as a Mint User on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that (i) such legal entity is duly organized and validly existing under the applicable laws of the jurisdiction of its organization; (ii) you are duly authorized by such legal entity to act on its behalf, and (iii) such organization (and any affiliate entity) must not have been previously suspended or removed from the Services or any other service or product offered by the Company or its affiliate entities.

Use of certain Services may have further eligibility requirements that will need to be verified prior to you using such Services or from time to time in order to continue your use of the Services and may be subject to additional terms and conditions.

By using your status as a Mint User and the Services, you further represent and warrant that:

- you are at least 18 years old and are not a Restricted Person, nor are you resident of a Restricted Territory (each as defined in Section 27 below).
- you will not be using your status as a Mint User and Services for any illegal activity, including, but not limited to, illegal gambling, money laundering, fraud, blackmail, extortion, ransoming data, terrorism financing, other violent activities or any prohibited market practices, including, but not limited to, those listed in the maxBTC Terms and Conditions.

You also understand that there are additional representations and warranties made by you elsewhere in (or by reference in) this Agreement and that any misrepresentation by you is a violation of this Agreement.

Non-accredited investor Users in the United States are not eligible to become Mint Users. This restriction may be revisited from time to time taking into account relevant changes in law.

When you register as a Mint User, you will be required to designate an administrator for your registration and provide a wallet address to be whitelisted. The Company may, in its discretion, enable functionality utilizing your status as a Mint User and some or all of the Services to other persons at your firm (e.g. your employees) (such persons, "Additional Users"). Such access is subject to the Company's review and approval, and such Additional Users' agreement to all of the terms hereof. To the extent that you choose to have Additional Users have access and control over the Mint User profile and relationship, you will have to designate those Additional Users and manage their access to your Mint User whitelisted wallets. By you requesting such access, you and all Additional Users automatically agree to this Agreement.

If the Company determines that you or any of your Additional Users have violated this Agreement, including, but not limited to, transacting with Blocked Addresses (as defined in the maxBTC Terms and Conditions) or engaging in Restricted Activities or Prohibited Transactions then the Company may be forced to terminate your status as a Mint User.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may determine not to make the Services, in whole or in part, available in every market, either in its sole discretion or due to legal or regulatory requirements, depending on your location. We may also, without liability to you or any third party, refuse to let you register as a Mint User in the Company's sole discretion.

1. **Registration Process; Identity Verification**

When registering as a Mint User, you must provide current, complete, and accurate information for all required elements on the registration page or via any third-party service providers (e.g., KYC/KYB information collection and screening providers), including your full legal name and the legal name of your organization. You also agree to provide us, when registering as a Mint User and on an ongoing basis, any additional information we request for the purposes of identity verification and the detection of money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other financial crime. You permit us to keep a record of such information and authorize us to make the inquiries, whether directly or through third parties, that we consider necessary or desirable to verify your identity or protect you and/or us against fraud or other financial crime, and to take action we reasonably deem necessary based on the results of such inquiries. When we carry out these inquiries, you understand, acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be disclosed to credit reference and fraud prevention or financial crime agencies and that these agencies may respond to our inquiries in full.

In certain circumstances, we may require you to submit additional information about yourself or your business, provide records, and complete other verification steps (such process, "Enhanced Due Diligence").

You represent and warrant that all information provided to us pursuant to this Agreement is true, accurate and not misleading in any respect. If any such information changes, it is your obligation to update such information as soon as possible.

From time to time we may be required to request further information or review or update existing information regarding your registration or your transactions to comply with applicable laws and regulation, and in some cases, payment network.
