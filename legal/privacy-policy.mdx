We may retain your data as long as you continue to use the Services, have an account with us, or for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. We may continue to retain your data even after you deactivate your account and/or cease to use the Service if such retention is reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our Terms or other agreements, and/or protect our legitimate interests. Where your data is no longer required for these purposes, we will delete it.

**DATA SECURITY**

We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to prevent accidental or intentional manipulation, partial or total loss, destruction or unauthorized access to your data by third parties. Our security measures are continuously improved in line with technological developments. Furthermore, all service providers commissioned by us are obliged by means of appropriate contractual agreements to take appropriate measures in accordance with the current state of the art to prevent the aforementioned risks.

Please be aware that, despite our reasonable efforts to protect your information, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee "perfect security." Please further note that any information you send to us electronically, while using the Services or otherwise interacting with us, may not be secure while in transit. We recommend that you do not use unsecure channels to communicate sensitive or confidential information to us. You are responsible for the security of your digital wallet(s), and urge you to take steps to ensure it is and remains secure.

In the event that any information under our custody and control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take steps to investigate and remediate the situation and, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised.

**Rights of Data Subjects under GDPR**

This section applies to you if you are able to avail yourself of certain rights under GDPR.
