In recognition of participation in Structured strategies such as maxBTC, in addition to rewards accrued by maxBTC, during your use of the Services, Structured may attribute certain reputation indicators, points, or other intangible rewards (collectively "Points") to users. Points are not, and may never convert to, accrue to, be used as basis to calculate, or become any other tokens or virtual assets or result in a distribution thereof. Points are virtual items with no monetary value. Points do not constitute any currency or property of any type and are not redeemable, refundable, or eligible for any fiat or virtual currency or anything else of value. Points are not transferable between users, and you may not attempt to sell, trade, or transfer any Points, or obtain any manner of credit using any Points. Any attempt to sell, trade, or transfer any Points or tokens redeemable for or representing any Points will be null and void.

While using the Services, and at all times applicable, you agree not to engage in any manipulative, fraudulent, dishonest, or abusive activities in connection with points or any distribution of digital assets by us or our affiliates. This includes, but is not limited to, creating multiple accounts to claim additional points or digital assets, using bots or scripts to automate claiming, or participating in any schemes that artificially inflate the number or perceived value of points or digital assets, including but not limited to wash trading. We or our affiliates may terminate any or all of your points due to such activities, or for breaching any license granted by us, and may disclose privately and publicly why such action was taken. Staking of points is strictly prohibited.

Points may not be available to persons who are citizens of, residents (tax or otherwise) of, green card holders of, incorporated in, owned or controlled by a person or entity in, located in, or has a registered office or principal place of business in the United States (defined as a "U.S. person"); persons who are acting for the account or benefit of any U.S. person; persons in any jurisdiction in which the offer, sale, holding, and/or purchase of digital assets or cryptocurrencies is unlawful, prohibited, or unauthorized (together with U.S. persons, a "Restricted Person"); or persons subject to sanctions or who are resident or nationals of a sanctioned jurisdiction.
