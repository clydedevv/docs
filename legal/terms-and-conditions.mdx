To the extent you have not completed the aforementioned checks or been whitelisted but hold maxBTC, these Terms and Conditions still apply to your holding and use of maxBTC (hereinafter referred as "**Holding User**"). For the avoidance of doubt, Holding Users are not customers or clients of Bondhive and have not entered into Mint User Agreements with Bondhive.

The Services includes an app or other front-end interface to the contracts that facilitate the minting or staking of digital assets (the "Protocol").

By minting or obtaining and using maxBTC, you understand and expressly agree to these and any other applicable Terms, regardless of whether or not you are a customer of Bondhive, and you acknowledge that you have reviewed and understand each of the disclosures made in this section. Any provisions of these Terms that only apply to Mint Users or Holding Users will be specifically noted herein. Unless so noted, each Section of these Terms apply to both Mint Users and Holding Users, and any use of "you" or "your" refers to both Mint Users and Holding Users. The terms herein applicable to Mint Users are supplemental to the terms in the maxBTC Mint User Agreement.

By holding or using maxBTC, or using any of the Services, you agree that you have read, understood and accept all of the terms and conditions contained in these Terms and Risk Disclosures, as well as our Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy, and you acknowledge and agree that you will be bound by these terms and policies.

Section 22 of these Terms governs how these Terms may be changed over time; the date of the last update is set forth at the top of these Terms.

1. **About maxBTC**

maxBTC is a digital token issued by Bondhive. maxBTC is issued by Bondhive via the Protocol. maxBTC does not represent a claim, participation interest, economic right, voting right, or other similar right associated with Bondhive, any Bondhive affiliate, or any other entity.

The maxBTC token is backed by an amount of spot crypto assets, such as BTC, ETH, SOL, JLP, certain stablecoins (such as USDC, USDT, and USDtb) ("maxBTC Reserves"). maxBTC is not designed to intrinsically create returns for holders, increase in value, or otherwise accrue financial benefit to the maxBTC holder. However, the price of maxBTC may increase or decrease based upon the value of the underlying maxBTC Reserves. To the extent redemption is enabled and allowed, maxBTC Mint Users may be entitled redeem maxBTC for the actual current market value of its pro rata portion of the maxBTC Reserves, which may be more or less than the original mint value depending on the performance of the underlying strategy, smart-contract and network fees and costs, and fees and costs associated with unwinding the strategies including slippage or other delays.

**Bondhive cannot and does not offer or guarantee the receipt of yield or other rewards in connection with your use of the Services, Platform, Protocol, or your use of maxBTC in conjunction with third-party products.**

1. **Scope of maxBTC and Key Terms**

**The following only applies to Mint Users:** As you have agreed to, and are subject to, the maxBTC Mint User Agreement, Bondhive makes available the following maxBTC-related Services (as defined in the maxBTC Mint User Agreement: (i) issue maxBTC for accepted tokens from Bondhive, and (ii) where applicable, redeem maxBTC for supported assets from Bondhive, Your use of the Services is subject to these Terms. Any of these Services can be discontinued at any time in accordance with Section 14 of these maxBTC Terms.

You understand and agree that, at this time, you may only tokenize accepted assets for maxBTC and redeem maxBTC directly with Bondhive to the extent that you are an approved Mint User.

**The following only applies to Holding Users:** You may not redeem maxBTC with Bondhive unless and until you are a Mint User who has cleared KYC/AML and other checks and have onboarded as a whitelisted customer with Bondhive. Eligibility for and requirements related to such process are set forth in the maxBTC Mint User Agreement.

**The following applies to both Mint Users and Holding Users:** Your use of maxBTC and maxBTC Services (as applicable), is subject to these Terms and Bondhive's obligations hereunder are conditional on you complying with its provisions. You understand that any violation of these Terms may result in potential consequences, including the possible loss or forfeiture of maxBTC and related Digital Assets.

You understand and agree that sending maxBTC to another address automatically transfers and assigns to the owner of that address , and any subsequent owner all rights and obligations of a Holding User to redeem maxBTC for approved assets so long as the Holder is or becomes a Mint User. For the avoidance of doubt, if a Holder is not a Mint User, not eligible to become a Mint User, or fails to do so, such Holding User is not entitled to redeem maxBTC with Bondhive.

Bondhive (or an affiliate designated by Bondhive) commits to redeem one (1) maxBTC for the actual current market value of User's pro rata portion of the maxBTC Reserves, which may be more or less than the original mint value depending on the performance of the underlying strategy, smart-contract and network fees and costs, and fees and costs associated with unwinding the strategies including slippage or other delays, subject to these Terms, applicable law, and any fees where applicable. While Bondhive may hold the maxBTC Reserves in interest-bearing accounts or other yield-generating instruments, you acknowledge that you are not entitled to any interest or other returns earned on such funds. maxBTC does not itself generate any interest or return for holders of maxBTC and only represents your right to redeem maxBTC as a Mint User, if you are one. If you are a Holding User, you do not have a right to redeem maxBTC with Bondhive.

1. **Applicable Laws and Regulations; AML and CTF**

Your holding and use of maxBTC, and any use of the maxBTC Services, is subject to the laws, regulations, and rules of any applicable governmental or regulatory authority, including, without limitation, all applicable tax, anti-money laundering ("AML") and counter-terrorist financing ("CTF") provisions and sanctions. You agree to act in compliance with and be legally bound by these Terms and all applicable laws and regulations. These Terms are conditional on your continued compliance at all times with these Terms and all applicable laws and regulations.

Bondhive is committed to complying with all applicable AML and CTF laws and regulations.

Bondhive takes compliance very seriously and actively engages in measures to:

- Prohibit fraudulent transactions;
- Report suspicious activities;
- Prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, and any related acts that facilitate financial crimes. Applicable laws require us to prevent Restricted Persons from holding maxBTC or using the Services. A Restricted Person means any person that is the subject or target of any sanctions, including a person that is:
    - named in any Sanctions-related list maintained by the U.S. Department of State; the U.S. Department of Commerce, including the Bureau of Industry and Security's Entity List and Denied Persons List; or the U.S. Department of the Treasury, including the OFAC Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List, the Sectoral Sanctions Identifications List, and the Foreign Sanctions Evaders List; or any similar list maintained by any other relevant governmental authority;
    - located, organized or resident in a country, territory or geographical region which is itself the subject or target of any territory-wide Sanctions (a "Restricted Territory") (currently, Cuba, Iran, Syria, North Korea, and the Ukraine regions of Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk); or
    - owned or controlled by any such person or persons listed above.

1. **Eligibility; Limitations**

**The following applies to both Mint Users and Holding Users:** maxBTC Services and support for maxBTC are currently only available to individuals and institutions (as applicable) located in supported jurisdictions.

By holding or using maxBTC, or accessing or using the maxBTC Services, you further represent and warrant that:

- you are at least 18 years old, are not a Restricted Person, and are not holding maxBTC on behalf of a Restricted Person.
- you will not be using maxBTC or the maxBTC Services (as applicable) for any illegal activity, including, but not limited to, illegal gambling, money laundering, fraud, blackmail, extortion, ransoming data, terrorism financing, other violent activities or any prohibited market practices, including, but not limited to, those listed under Sections 16 and 17.

Additionally, users in the United States are not eligible to become a Mint User. This restriction may be revisited from time to time taking into account relevant changes in law.

You also understand that there are additional representations and warranties made by you elsewhere in (or by reference in) these Terms and that any misrepresentation by you is a violation of these Terms.

If Bondhive suspects or determines that you or any of your authorized users or customers, as applicable, have violated these Terms, including, but not limited to, attempting to transact or transacting with Blocked Addresses (as defined in Section 11) or attempting to engage or engaging in Restricted Activities (as defined in Section 16) or Prohibited Transactions (as defined in Section 17), then Bondhive may be forced to terminate your status as a Mint User and you may forfeit any assets otherwise eligible for redemption.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Bondhive may determine not to make maxBTC or the maxBTC Services, in whole or in part, available in every market, either in its sole discretion or due to legal or regulatory requirements, depending on your location. We may also, without liability to you or any third party, refuse to let you register as a Mint User.

The following only applies to Mint Users: Use of certain maxBTC Services may have further eligibility requirements that will need to be verified prior to you using such maxBTC Services, or from time to time in order to continue your use of the maxBTC Services, and may be subject to additional terms and conditions.

1. **Support**

Please contact Support at legal@hadronlabs.org to report any violations of these Terms or to ask any questions regarding these Terms or the maxBTC Services, as applicable.

1. **Copies, Wrappers, and Forks Not Supported**

The following applies to both Mint Users and Holding Users: As a result of the current or eventual decentralized and open source nature of maxBTC it is possible that a party unaffiliated with Bondhive could create an alternative, equivalent version of maxBTC either on one of the maxBTC supported blockchains or on an unsupported blockchain (a "copy") that operate independently from maxBTC. Similarly, it is possible that a party unaffiliated with Bondhive may create an asset and purport that such asset is collateralized by or otherwise incorporates maxBTC into its design (a "wrapper"). Bondhive supports only maxBTC and is under no obligation to support any copies of maxBTC or wrappers and assumes no responsibility for any value that might be lost as a result of this lack of support of copies of maxBTC. No such copy or wrapper should be considered approved, sold, distributed, or promoted by Bondhive unless explicitly stated.

As a result of the decentralized and open source nature of the blockchains on which maxBTC is supported, it is possible that a party unaffiliated with Bondhive could create an alternative version of the blockchain (a "fork"). Note that in the event of a fork of one of the maxBTC supported blockchains, Bondhive may be forced to suspend all activities relating to maxBTC (including tokenizing assets for maxBTC, redeeming maxBTC for supported assets, or sending and receiving maxBTC) for an extended period of time until Bondhive has determined in its sole discretion that such functionality can be restored ("Downtime"). This Downtime will likely occur immediately upon a "fork", potentially with little to no warning, and during this period of Downtime you will not be able to conduct various activities involving maxBTC. In the event of a fork of one of the maxBTC supported blockchains, Bondhive shall, in its sole discretion, determine which fork it will support, if any.

1. **maxBTC Supported Blockchains and Smart Contract Modifications**

maxBTC operates on maxBTC supported blockchains. Bondhive does not have any ability or obligation to prevent or mitigate attacks or resolve any other issues that might arise with any maxBTC supported blockchain. Any such attacks or delays on any maxBTC supported blockchain might materially delay or prevent you from sending or receiving maxBTC, and Bondhive shall bear no responsibility for any losses that result from such issues.

Note that in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, a copy or fork of a maxBTC supported blockchain or the identification of a security issue with a maxBTC supported blockchain, Bondhive may be forced to suspend all activities relating to maxBTC (including tokenizing assets for maxBTC, redeeming maxBTC for assets, or sending and receiving maxBTC) for an extended period of time until such Downtime is over and maxBTC Services can be restored. This Downtime will likely occur immediately upon a copy or fork of any maxBTC supported blockchain, potentially with little to no warning, and during this period of Downtime you will not be able to conduct various activities involving maxBTC.

Bondhive reserves the right to migrate maxBTC to another blockchain or protocol in the future in its reasonable discretion. Upon Bondhive's request, you agree to take any and all actions reasonably necessary to effectuate the migration of your maxBTC to another blockchain or protocol identified by Bondhive. Bondhive will not be responsible or liable for any damages, losses, costs, fines, penalties or expenses of whatever nature, whether or not reasonably foreseeable by the parties, which you may suffer, sustain or incur, arising out of or relating to your failure to effectuate such migration of your maxBTC to another blockchain or protocol identified by Bondhive.

1. **Limited License; IP Rights**

**The following only applies to Mint Users:** We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, and non-transferable license, subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, to access and use the maxBTC Services solely for approved purposes as determined by Bondhive.

- No guarantee of price stability on third-party platforms;
- Bondhive does not guarantee that the value of one (1) maxBTC will always or ever equal to the price of one (1) Bitcoin or any specific USD denominated amount on any platform. Due to a variety of factors, the value of maxBTC on third-party platforms such as cryptocurrency exchange platforms could fluctuate, and the risk factors highlighted herein (as well as presently unknown risk factors) may result in the maxBTC Reserves falling to less than the Bitcoin or other deposited equivalent of value per maxBTC in circulation. Bondhive cannot control how third parties quote or value maxBTC, and Bondhive is not responsible for any losses or other issues that may result from fluctuations in the value of maxBTC.
- Assets used to mint maxBTC that are subject to yield-generating strategies including but not limited to delta-neutral strategies. These strategies may underperform, resulting in the total value of maxBTC Reserves being less than the original minting value.
- The redemption value depends entirely on the actual performance of the underlying reserves and strategies.
- Past performance of strategies does not guarantee future results. Market conditions, execution risks, and other factors may cause strategies to generate losses.
- Presently, maxBTC has no market price, only an internal NAV based on underlying reserve value
- Redemption requires unwinding strategies, which may involve slippage, fees, or delays.
- Redemption value is variable and depends on strategy performance, reserve liquidity, and execution costs, not a guaranteed pro-rata claim.
- No guarantee, warranty, or representation is made regarding the value of maxBTC or the generation of a minimum amount of yield or additional value accruing to maxBTC.
- Users assume all risk of loss associated with the underlying strategies, volatility, market and commercial risk, CEX and DEX risk, and market performance.

- **Third-Parties.** Bondhive does not control or endorse any products, services, or platforms offered by third parties using the maxBTC Services or supporting maxBTC.

- **Blocked Addresses & Forfeited Funds. Bondhive reserves the right to "block" certain maxBTC addresses of Mint Users that it determines, in its sole discretion, may be associated with illegal activity or activity that otherwise violates these Terms ("Blocked Addresses"). In certain circumstances, Bondhive may deem it necessary to report such suspected illegal activity to applicable law enforcement agencies and you may forfeit any rights associated with your maxBTC, including the ability to redeem maxBTC for any permitted assets. Bondhive may also be required to surrender associated assets held in the maxBTC Reserve in the event it receives a legal order from a valid government authority requiring it to do so.**
- **Software protocols and operational challenges. You are aware of and accept the risk of operational challenges. Bondhive may experience sophisticated cyber-attacks, unexpected surges in activity or other operational or technical difficulties that may cause interruptions to the maxBTC Services.

You agree to accept the risk of transaction failure resulting from unanticipated or heightened technical difficulties, including those resulting from sophisticated attacks. You agree not to hold Bondhive accountable for any related losses.**
- **Compliance. You are responsible for complying with applicable law.

You are solely responsible for reporting and paying any taxes arising from your use of maxBTC or the maxBTC Services, including any accurate reporting of the tax or legal status of maxBTC in your jurisdiction.**
- **Legal treatment of maxBTC transfers. The regulatory status of maxBTC and blockchain technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to maxBTC, blockchain technology and its applications. Accordingly, it is not possible to determine whether a maxBTC transfer would be recognized under applicable law by a court or regulator.**
- **Legislative and regulatory changes. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the international level may adversely affect the tokenization of assets into maxBTC, and the use, transfer, redemption and/or value of maxBTC.**
- **Claim on funds. Only Mint Users can only redeem maxBTC directly with Bondhive through the Protocol. For Mint Users, your ability to redeem with us for each maxBTC is conditional on (i) your possession of a corresponding amount of maxBTC associated with a Mint User, (ii) no violation of these Terms or your maxBTC Mint User Agreement, and (iii) no action, pending or otherwise, by a regulator, law enforcement or a court of competent jurisdiction that would restrict redemption.**
- **Sending maxBTC to another address automatically transfers and assigns to that Holding User, and any subsequent Holding User, the right to redeem maxBTC with us so long as the Holding User is eligible to, and does, register as a Mint User (and thereby becomes a Mint User).**
- **Encumbrances. Depending on the actions of the owners of maxBTC addresses before your receipt of maxBTC from another maxBTC address, it is possible that the transfer of maxBTC between maxBTC addresses could result in the maxBTC in your whitelisted wallet becoming subject to a lien or other form of security interest before redemption.**
- **On-chain transactions irreversible. When maxBTC is sent to a third-party maxBTC address, such transaction is completed on maxBTC supported blockchains. This means that such a transaction is irreversible and Bondhive does not have the ability to reverse or recall any transaction once initiated. You bear all responsibility for any losses that might be incurred as a result of sending maxBTC to an incorrect or unintended maxBTC address.**
- **Affiliate activities. You understand and agree that individuals or entities affiliated with Bondhive may hold, purchase, sell, or otherwise engage in transactions using or involving maxBTC. You further understand and agree that such persons may engage in this activity for any reason, including but not limited to engaging in commercial transactions, promoting transaction activity that utilizes maxBTC, or otherwise supporting the use or adoption of maxBTC. This activity may involve selling maxBTC to other entities for provision to their end users. You understand and agree that no individual or entity, whether affiliated with Bondhive or otherwise, is under any obligation to engage in these activities, and they may be discontinued at any time.**

1. **Fees; Authorization**

**The following only applies to Mint Users:** Except as disclosed to you prior to completing a transaction as a Mint User, Bondhive will not charge you any fees for tokenizing assets for maxBTC, or receiving maxBTC. Any cost of executing a mint or redemption transaction is a cost reimbursement to cover friction such as blockchain gas fees or execution fees paid by Bondhive.

1. **Currency Conversion**

The following only applies to Mint Users: All tokenizations of assets will be credited in maxBTC to your whitelisted wallet(s) based on a rate of one (1) maxBTC per (1) BTC of notional value, as the case may be, depending on the asset exchanged to mint maxBTC, less applicable fees and transaction costs associated with the transaction, including, for the avoidance of doubt, fees paid associated with the applicable blockchain consensus mechanism. Such value shall be calculated by Bondhive based on the asset in its sole discretion, with any transaction fees associated with the blockchain consensus mechanism determined by requirements of the underlying blockchain at the time the transaction is submitted by the Mint User.

For the avoidance of doubt, as the price of maxBTC may increase or decrease based upon the value of the underlying maxBTC Reserves and to the extent redemption is enabled and allowed, redemption of maxBTC by maxBTC Mint Users may not result in a value equivalent to the notional value of one (1) BTC or the minting value of the maxBTC.   maxBTC redemptions will be determined by the current market value of the Mint User's pro rata portion of the maxBTC Reserves at the time of redemption denominated in BTC.

1. **Right to Change/Remove Features or Suspend/Delay Transactions**

The following only applies to Mint Users: We reserve the right to (i) change, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the maxBTC Services at any time, including hours of operation or availability of any feature, without notice and without liability and (ii) decline to process any issuance or redemption without prior notice and may limit or suspend your use of one or more maxBTC Services at any time, in our sole discretion. Our rights under this paragraph are subject to our obligations under applicable law and licenses, including but not limited to our reasonable suspicion of inappropriate or illegal conduct. Suspension of your use of any of the maxBTC Services will not affect your rights and obligations pursuant to these Terms. We may, in our sole discretion, delay issuances or redemptions if we reasonably believe the transaction is suspicious, may involve fraud or misconduct, violates applicable laws, or violates the terms of these Terms.

1. **Transactions Irreversible**

**The following only applies to Mint Users:** Once a transaction has been initiated, it cannot be reversed, as further described in Section 11 above and pursuant to the underlying blockchain consensus mechanism. Except as set forth in these Terms, all transactions processed through the maxBTC Services are nonrefundable.
